# The Interactive ZIPScribble Map

This content has moved to <a href="/zipscribble-map">this page</a>.

The idea behind <a href="/zipscribble-maps/united-states">the ZIPScribble Map</a> is simple: Connect all the ZIP or postal codes in a country in ascending order. Does that produce chaos or some kind of pattern? Use this interactive map to explore.

At the bottom of the selector is also the <a href="/blog/2016/new-improved-traveling-presidential-candidate-map">Traveling Presidential Candidate Map</a>.

>	I sell items on Amazon.com and I've been trying to find a way to virtually 'put a pushpin' on a map for every customer's zip code. It sounds silly, but I want to see where all my sales have ended up. Not for marketing purposes, just out of curiosity. I came across your zip scribble map in the process. It's very interesting and I must commend you for a new map of the USA.  :)  thanks

David says…
>	I went to the polymaps website, and found the same error there, so it's apparently on their end.  I checked in chrome and everything works fine.  I'll give them a heads up.

>	In some regards, the ZIP Code system makes sense per the state level. As well as in some large cities and those in very rural areas,

>	For example, In Eastern New York State, Orange County Zips are nearly all 109. However there is a small section of the county where the code is 127. Here's where it gets "silly". To find adjacent , in numerical order,( i,e, 126, 127) codes one must travel well north of Albany to the far northeastern part of the state. I have searched many resources and cannot find any info as to how the USPS arrived at these assigned numbers. Nor can I find a methodology.
