They differ from the common graphical user interfaces used for visualization tools in many ways, and have their own strengths and weaknesses. In particular, they allow easy sharing, experimentation, and collaboration, and provide context about the data for different kinds of users. They also integrate modeling, forecasting, and complex analyses directly with the visualization. We believe that notebooks provide a unique and fundamentally new way of working with and understanding data. By laying out their unique properties, we hope to inspire both researchers and practitioners to investigate their many uses, explore their pros and cons, and share their findings.",

In this paper, we question this assumption and demonstrate that observed encodings often differ from the ones used to specify the visualization. The value of a chart also often comes from higher level derived encodings, and which encodings end up getting used also depends on the user’s task.",

		"abstract": "Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences."

		"abstract": "We introduce Diatoms, a technique that generates design inspiration for glyphs by sampling from palettes of mark shapes, encoding channels, and glyph scaffold shapes. Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a small permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers' reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked."

Modeling these changes and comparing them to study participants’ estimates allows us to rank the different visual cues by model fit. Area emerges as the most likely cue used to read pie charts."

		"doi": "10.2312/evs20191162",
		"abstract": "Minimization of disclosure risks is a key challenge in publicly available visualizations that can potentially reveal personal information. Such risks are inherently dependent on the amount of information that adversaries can gain by manipulating visual representations and by using their background knowledge. Conventional risk quantification models proposed in the field of privacy-preserving data mining suffer from a lack of transparency in letting data owners control privacy parameters and understand their implications for disclosure risks. To fill this gap, we propose a visual uncertainty model for letting data owners understand the relationships between privacy parameters and vulnerable visualization configurations. Our main contribution is a probabilistic analysis of the disclosure risks associated with vulnerabilities in privacy-preserving parallel coordinates and scatter plots. We quantify the relationship among attack scenarios, adversarial knowledge, and the inherent uncertainty in cluster-based visualizations that can act as defense mechanisms. We present examples and a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model."

Centered shapes turn out to lead to much worse accuracy than any other stimuli, even the same shape when not centered. These first results point to the need for more systematic explorations of the design spaces around existing charts."

This mirrors the popular inverted pyramid style of writing that presents the most important information up front, to be followed by evidence. We have found a subset of stories that follow a more structured approach, however. These stories begin with a claim or question, but do not immediately present that as the conclusion. Instead, they then present pieces of evidence that are only tied together, and back to the initial claim, at the end. In this paper, we formalize and discuss this structure, and present a few examples. We believe that this is a viable and practical model for data stories more generally, and certainly a stronger arc than most existing stories today.",

Previous work has found that some of the shapes used, like rounded tops, triangles, etc., decreased accuracy when judging relative and absolute sizes, while T-shaped bars even showed a slight increase relative to the basic bar chart. In this paper, we report on a study that adds pictorial elements to bar charts of four different shapes tested previously, thus also including the elements of color and texture. We find that pictorial bar charts reduce accuracy, but not beyond the effect already observed for their shape. They also do not significantly increase response time. Embellished bar charts may not be as problematic as commonly assumed.",

We contribute findings from several studies examining visualization sequencing and reception. In our first study, people made decisions between various possible structures as they ordered a set of related visualizations (consisting of either bar charts or thematic maps) into what they considered the clearest sequence for showing the data. We find that most people structure visualization sequences hierarchically: they create high level groupings based on shared data properties like time period, measure, level of aggregation, and spatial region, then order the views within these groupings. We also observe a tendency for certain types of similarities between views, like a common spatial region or aggregation level, to be seen as more appropriate categories for organizing views in a sequence than others, like a common time period or measure. In a second study, we find that viewers’ perceptions of the quality and intention of different sequences are largely consistent with the perceptions of the users who created them. The understanding of sequence preferences and perceptions that emerges from our studies has implications for the development of visualization authoring tools and sequence recommendations for guided analysis.",

		"abstract": "If we were to design Information Visualization from scratch, we would start with the basics: understand the principles of perception, test how they apply to different data encodings, build up those encodings to see if the principles still apply, etc. Instead, visualization was created from the other end: by building visual displays without an idea of how or if they worked, and then finding the relevant perceptual and other basics here and there. This approach has the problem that we end up with a very patchy understanding of the foundations of our field. More than that, there is a good amount of unproven assumptions, aesthetic judgments, etc.~mixed in with the evidence. We often don't even realize how much we rely on the latter, and can't easily identify them because they have been so deeply incorporated into the fabric of our field. In this paper, I attempt to tease apart what we know and what we only think we know, using a few examples. The goal is to point out specific gaps in our knowledge, and to encourage researchers in the field to start questioning the underlying assumptions. Some of them are probably sound and will hold up to scrutiny. But some of them will not. We need to find out which is which and systematically build up a better foundation for our field. If we intend to develop ever more and better techniques and systems, we can't keep ignoring the base, or it will all come tumbling down sooner or later."

In this paper, we build on that study to test several pie chart variations that are popular in information graphics: exploded pie chart, pie with larger slice, elliptical pie, and square pie (in addition to a regular pie chart used as the baseline). We find that even variants that do not distort central angle cause greater error than regular pie charts. Charts that distort the shape show the highest error.

Specifically, our key contributions are the following: i) characterization of the domain-specific goals and their translation to exploratory data analysis tasks, ii) developing an analytical abstraction in the form of perceptually motivated screen-space metrics for bridging the gap between the tasks and the visualization, and iii) realization of the tasks and metrics in the form of VIMTEX, which is a set of coordinated multiple views for letting scientists observe multivariate, temporal relationships in the data.

This paper builds on that work by introducing a number of metrics that can be used to assess both the level of privacy and the amount of utility that can be gained from the resulting visualizations. We also generalize our approach beyond parallel coordinates to scatter plots and other visualization techniques. Privacy preservation generally entails a trade-off between privacy and utility: the more the data are protected, the less useful the visualization. Using a visually-oriented approach, we can provide a higher amount of utility than directly applying data anonymization techniques used in data mining. To demonstrate this, we use the visual uncertainty framework for systematically defining metrics based on cluster artifacts and information theoretic principles. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique as compared to standard data-based clustering in the context of privacy-preserving visualization."

It is still unclear how users perceive the size of the words in tag clouds and how they make their judgments of the size of words. In this poster, we look at how users estimate the relative sizes of words given different characteristics. We studied the influence of decorations like filled areas, boxes, and shadows to determine whether they would influence the perceived size. Another parameter we tested was the appearance of words (i.e. by choosing words with and without ascenders and descenders). We found significant effects from all of those parameters, which suggests that designers of tag clouds need to be aware of the influence of design choices on the perceived data."

		"abstract": "Managing computational complexity and designing effective visual representations are two important challenges for the visualization of large, complex, high-dimensional datasets. Parallel coordinates are an effective technique for visualizing high-dimensional data, but do not scale well to very large datasets. The addition of the tempo- ral dimension leads to more uncertainty due to clutter on screen. Consequently, this poses a significant challenge for visually find- ing trends and patterns that maximize insight about the underlying time-varying properties of the data. To address these problems, we present meta parallel coordinates, a parallel coordinates display that is guided by perceptually motivated visual metrics. These metrics describe the visual structures typically found in parallel coordinates and thus aid the user’s analysis by providing meaningful views of the data. Since they are computed in screen space, our metrics are computationally more efficient than data-based metrics. Our choice of metrics is driven by the different analytical tasks that a user typically wants to perform with time-varying multivariate data. In particular, we have worked with domain scientists who performed simulations of bioremediation experiments, and use their data and results to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach."

		"abstract": "The genomes of prokaryotes are dynamic and shuffling of gene order occurs frequently, along with horizontal transfer of genes from external sources. Local conservation of gene order tends to reflect functional constraints on the genome or on a biochemical subsystem. Comparison of the local gene neighborhoods surrounding a gene of interest gives insight into evolutionary history and functional potential of the gene. The Genomic Ring Visualization Tool (Gene-RiViT) is a high speed, intuitive visualization tool for investigating sequence environments of conserved genes among related genomes. Gene-RiViT allows the user to interact with interconnected global and local visualizations of gene neighborhoods and gene order, through a web-based interface that is easily accessible in any browser. The primary visualization is a wheel of nested rotating circles, each of which represents a single genome. This visualization is similar to common circular genome alignment views, except that the rings can be realigned with each other dynamically based on user selections within the ring view or one of the coordinated views. By allowing the user to dynamically realign genomes and focus on a locally conserved region of interest, and using orthology connections to highlight corresponding structures among genomes, this view provides insight into gene context and preservation of neighbor relationships as genomes evolve. Visualizations are linked into a coordinated multiple view interface to provide multiple selection methods and entry points into the data. These approaches make Gene-RiViT a flexible, unique tool for examining gene neighborhoods that improves on existing methods."

Existing research on uncertainty in visualization mainly focuses on depicting data-space uncertainty in a visual form. Uncertainty is thus often seen as a problem to deal with, in the data, and something to be avoided if possible. In this paper, we highlight the need for analyzing visual uncertainty in order to design more effective visual representations. We study various forms of uncertainty in the visual representation of parallel coordinates and propose a taxonomy for categorizing them. By building a taxonomy, we aim to identify different sources of uncertainty in the screen space and relate them to different effects of uncertainty upon the user. We examine the literature on parallel coordinates and apply our taxonomy to categorize various techniques for reducing uncertainty. In addition, we consider uncertainty from a different perspective by identifying cases where increasing certain forms of uncertainty may even be useful, with respect to task, data type and analysis scenario. This work suggests that uncertainty is a feature that can be both useful and problematic in visualization, and it is beneficial to augment an information visualization pipeline with a facility for visual uncertainty analysis."

Visualization, on the other hand, has seen little, if any, work on handling sensitive data. With the growing applicability of data visualization in real-world scenarios, the handling of sensitive data has become a non-trivial issue we need to address in developing visualization tools. With this goal in mind, in this paper, we analyze the issue of privacy from a visualization perspective and propose a privacy-preserving visualization technique based on clustering in parallel coordinates.

We propose the use of multi-touch interaction to provide fast and convenient interaction with parallel coordinates. By using a multi-touch trackpad rather than the screen directly, the user’s hands do not obscure the visualization during interaction. Using one, two, three, or four fingers, the user can easily and quickly perform complex selections. Being able to change the selections rapidly, the user can explore the data set more easily and effectively, and can focus on the data rather than the interaction."

Researchers in the field of data mining have proposed different techniques over the years for privacy-preserving data publishing and subsequent mining techniques on such sanitized data. A well-known drawback in these methods is that for even a small guarantee of privacy, the utility of the datasets is greatly reduced. In this paper, we propose an adaptive technique for privacy preservation in parallel coordinates. Based on knowledge about the sensitivity of the data, we compute a clustered representation on the fly, which allows the user to explore the data without breaching privacy. Through the use of screen-space privacy metrics, the technique adapts to the user’s screen parameters and interaction.

Previous research has suggested that people see parts of a visualization as objects, and may metaphorically interpret apparent physical relationships between these objects as suggestive of data relationships. We explored this hypothesis in detail in a series of user experiments. Inspired by the concept of implied dynamics in psychology, we first studied whether perceived gravity acting on a mark in a scatterplot can lead to errors in a participant’s recall of the mark’s position. The results of this study suggested that such position errors exist, but may be more strongly influenced by attraction between marks. We hypothesized that such apparent attraction may be influenced by elements used to suggest relationship between objects, such as connecting lines, grouping elements, and visual similarity. We further studied what visual elements are most likely to cause this attraction effect, and whether the elements that best predicted attraction errors were also those which suggested conceptual relationships most strongly. Our findings show a correlation between attraction errors and intuitions about relatedness, pointing towards a possible mechanism by which the perception of visual marks becomes an interpretation of data relationships.",

		"abstract": "Interactive visualization requires the translation of data into a screen space of limited resolution. While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, over-plotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user’s preferences based on our metrics and model.",

We propose a theory that embeds information visualization within other visual traditions in terms of criteria that are not purely technical: dependence on data, mapping, interactivity, and notationality. In addition to providing the means for a classification, these criteria also foster a different understanding of information visualization. We further adapt our criteria to differentiate within visualization, using mapping, readability and information loss, and notationality as the criteria. Both sets of criteria are demonstrated in a number of case studies. We believe that our novel taxonomies of visualization methods serve as a step towards a more comprehensive theoretical context to understanding the essential purposes, properties, and functions of information visualization."

This view predicts that even seemingly meaningless properties of a visualization, including such minor design elements as borders, background areas, and the connectedness of parts, may affect how people perceive semantic aspects of data by suggesting different potential dynamics between data points.

Classical visualization theory sees this as a process of encoding data variables as visual variables, which the viewer then decodes. Although this body of theory is useful, it doesn’t account for visual structure’s role in shaping information. Experiments on how design affects users’ interpretations of simple visualizations suggest that structural elements such as borders, fills, and arrangement (in addition to the traditional marks) carry significant, predictable semantic information. Drawing on these findings as well as design traditions, the authors argue that visual structure’s apparent dynamics play a major role in a user's understanding of data and must be considered in the design and evaluation of visualizations.",

The result is that many of these programs are hacked together, buggy, and embarrassing. Consequently, they do not get released together with the paper, which leads to a fundamental problem in visualization: reproducibility is possible in theory, but in practice rarely happens. Many programs and new techniques are also built from scratch rather than based on existing ones. The optimal model would be to release the software right away, then come back to it later to refine and re-architect it to reflect the overall design goals of the project. This is seldom done, because there is usually nothing to be gained from a re-implementation (or thorough refactoring), so people move on to the next project. The original prototype implementation of Parallel Sets was no different. But we decided that in order to get the idea out of academia into actual use, we would need a working program. So we set out to rethink and redesign it, based on a better understanding of the necessary internal structures we gained over time. We did not only re-engineer the program, but also revise the visualization itself to clarify the overall idea."

Participants were asked to rate each company on a series of semantic dimensions. The results show a significant effect of minor design elements on semantic interpretations of data, and comments by participants further suggest that these effects may be grounded in physical and emotional inferences derived from the appearance of charts."

We have proposed visual metaphors as a framework for understanding high-level visual structure and its effect on visualization use. Although there is some evidence that visual metaphors can affect visualization use, the nature of this effect is still ambiguous. We propose that a user's preconceived metaphors for data and other individual differences play an important role in her ability to think in a variety of visual metaphors, and subsequently in her ability to use a visualization. We test this hypothesis by conducting a study in which a participant's preconceptions and thinking style were compared with the degree to which she is affected by conflicting metaphors in a visualization and its task questions. The results show that metaphor compatibility has a significant effect on accuracy, but that factors such as spatial ability and personality can lessen this effect. We also find a complex influence of self-reported metaphor preference on performance. These findings shed light on how people use visual metaphors to understand a visualization."

By allowing the user the freedom to link entities by their activities over time, we provide a new framework for comparison of event sequences. Our scoring mechanism is robust and flexible, giving the user the flexibility to define the extent to which time is considered in aligning entities. Incorporated with high interactivity, the user can efficiently navigate through tens of thousands of records recorded in over a hundred dimensions of data by choosing combinations of categories to examine.

		"abstract": "The nature of an information visualization can be considered to lie in the visual metaphors it uses to structure information. The process of understanding a visualization therefore involves an interaction between these external visual metaphors and the user’s internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual and verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results (based on correctness and response time) suggest that the visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user’s ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.",

The correlation of two sequences can provide important clues as to the possibility of a connection between the responsible entities, but an analyst might not be able to specify the type of connection sought prior to examination.

It is extremely difficult – if not impossible – to establish rules for making good art or designing a new object. Instead of generative rules, there are well-established guidelines, styles, and best practices that often only apply to a finished object, or at least a reasonable sketch. Criticizing a work means applying these standards to identify weaknesses and suggest improvements. Some say that it is much less important in art to know how to do something specific than it is to know how to \"see.\" Visualization is in many respects similar to design and art: we know a good visualization when we see it (or run a controlled user study on it), but it is impossible to define constructive rules how to design an effective visualization. Critiquing can be a useful tool for teaching, developing better techniques, and more theoretical thinking about visualization.",

		"abstract": "Numerous systems have been developed to display large collections of data for urban contexts; however, most have focused on layering of single dimensions of data and manual calculations to understand relationships within the urban environment. Furthermore, these systems often limit the user's perspectives on the data, thereby diminishing the user's spatial understanding of the viewing region. In this paper, we introduce a highly interactive urban visualization tool that provides intuitive understanding of the urban data. Our system utilizes an aggregation method that combines buildings and city blocks into legible clusters, thus providing continuous levels of abstraction while preserving the user's mental model of the city. In conjunction with a 3D view of the urban model, a separate but integrated information visualization view displays multiple disparate dimensions of the urban data, allowing the user to understand the urban environment both spatially and cognitively in one glance. For our evaluation, expert users from various backgrounds viewed a real city model with census data and confirmed that our system allowed them to gain more intuitive and deeper understanding of the urban model from different perspectives and levels of abstraction than existing commercial urban visualization systems."

We propose a classification of several types of information visualization based on aesthetic criteria. The notions of artistic and pragmatic visualization are introduced, and their properties discussed. Finally, the idea of visualization criticism is proposed, and its rules are laid out. Visualization criticism bridges the gap between design, art, and technical/pragmatic information visualization. It guides the view away from implementation details and single mouse clicks to the meaning of a visualization."

In this paper, we present a new approach for the interactive visual analysis of flow simulation data, which is especially targeted at the analysis of time-dependent data. This supports the flexible specification and visualization of flow features in an interactive setup of multiple linked views. Special emphasis is put on new mechanisms to capture time-dependent features (i.e. flow features that are inherently dependent on time). We propose the integration of attribute derivation into the process of interactive visual analysis to enable the subsequent user access to otherwise implicit properties of the unsteady data in our interactive feature specification framework. All views of this flow analysis setup are linked, in the sense that the features in focus are consistently emphasized in the visualization (more colorful, less transparent) whereas the rest of the data are only shown as context in reduced style. In addition to introducing our new approach, we also demonstrate its use in the context of several application examples.",

Parallel Sets are a new method for the visualization and interactive exploration of categorical data that shows data frequencies instead of the individual data points. The method is based on the axis layout of parallel coordinates, with boxes representing the categories and parallelograms between the axes showing the relations between categories. In addition to the visual representation, we designed a rich set of interactions. Parallel Sets allow the user to interactively remap the data to new categorizations, and thus to consider more data dimensions during exploration and analysis than usually possible. At the same time, a meta-level, semantic representation of the data is built. Common procedures, like building the cross product of two or more dimensions, can be performed automatically, thus complementing the interactive visualization. We demonstrate Parallel Sets by analyzing a large CRM data set, as well as investigating housing data of two US states."

Methods that work very well for continuous data are often hardly usable with categorical dimensions. Only few methods deal properly with such data, mostly because of the discrete nature of categorical data, which does not translate well into the continuous domains of space and color. Parallel Sets is a new visualization method that adopts the layout of parallel coordinates, but substitutes the individual data points by a frequency-based representation. This abstracted view, combined with a set of carefully designed interactions, supports visual data analysis of large and complex data sets. The technique allows efficient work with meta data, which is particularly important when dealing with categorical datasets. By creating new dimensions from existing ones, for example, the user can filter the data according to his or her current needs. We also present the results from an interactive analysis of CRM data using Parallel Sets. We demonstrate how the flexible lay- out eases the process of knowledge crystallization, especially when combined with a sophisticated interaction scheme."

We propose a combination of 2D and 3D scatterplots, together with some extensions to overcome these problems. By linking 2D and 3D views, it is possible to interact in 2D and get feedback in 3D. That feedback is also enhanced by depth cues (color and point size) such that the user gets a better depth impression. Histograms in 2D and 3D show additional information about point densities and additional context can be displayed. An example application demonstrates the usefulness of the technique."

This paper introduces a method and a tool that was designed to provide a solution for that bottleneck. The so-called Guideline Markup Tool (GMT) facilitates the translation of guidelines into a formal representation written in XML. This tool enables the protocol designer to create links between the original guideline and its formal representation and ease the editing of guidelines applying design patterns in the form of macros. The usefulness of our approach is illustrated using GMT to edit Asbru protocols. We performed a usability study with eight participants to examine the usefulness of the GMT and of the Asbru macros, which showed that the proposed approach is very appropriate to author and maintain clinical guidelines."

Interaction allows the user to implicitly form mental models of the correlations and relationships in the data, through recognition of patterns, marking or focusing in on those patterns, forming mental hypotheses and testing them, and so on. Some interaction techniques are very specific to InfoVis (even though they can be and are applied to other areas as well), such as Focus+Context and Linking+Brushing.

Most guidelines today either exist as plain text, tables, or flow-charts. We present two tools that support this translation: The Guideline Markup Tool (GMT) and the Pontifex Intelligent XML Editor Extension (PIXEE). The GMT provides a relatively easy way to translate free text into Asbru. It does this by displaying both the original text and the translation, and showing the user which parts of the Asbru code correspond to which elements of the original text. This not only makes it easier to author plans, but also to understand the resulting Asbru constructs in terms of the original guideline. PIXEE is a more general XML editor that has some special features due to a richer representation of the language than pure XML. It provides means to aggregate information dynamically and also to more effectively work with language constructs. Both these tools make the translation into a formal language easier and therefore enable us to formally verify guidelines, thus reducing errors and ambiguities in them."

It is, however, impossible for a domain expert to work with Asbru directly. Therefore, a visualisation called AsbruView is presented here, which uses three-dimensional diagrams and metaphors — running tracks and traffic signs — to make the parts of Asbru easily understandable and usable. Even very complex clinical plans are easy to understand with AsbruView."

We utilize a well-known method from photography and cinematography (depth-of-field effect) for information visualization, which is to blur different parts of the depicted scene in dependence of their relevance. Independent of their spatial locations, objects of interest are depicted sharply in SDOF, whereas the context of the visualization is blurred. In this paper, we present a flexible model of SDOF which can be easily adopted to various types of applications. We discuss pros and cons of the new technique, give examples of application, and describe a fast prototype implementation of SDOF."

		"abstract": "Time plays an important role in medicine. Conditions are not just evaluated at single instants in time, but traced over periods. Medications must be administered within specified temporal limits, and their effects observed with regard to time. When planning treatments, the temporal aspect becomes even more complicated. The planner has to deal with uncertainty and allowable intervals. A visual representation of the information would be helpful, but there are few visualizations of time that are powerful enough. We present a visualization that graphically represents a complex notion of time, and has also been implemented in a program that allows users to directly specify this information. The results of a small user study are reported."

		"abstract": "Therapy planning plays an increasingly important role in the everyday work of physicians. Clinical protocols or guidelines are typically represented using ̄ow-charts, decision tables, or plain text. These representations are badly suited, however, for complex medical procedures. One representation method that overcomes these problems is the language Asbru. But because Asbru has a LISP-like syntax (and also incorporates many concepts from computer science), it is not suitable for physicians. Therefore, we developed a visualization and user interface to deal with treatment plans expressed in Asbru. We use graphical metaphors to make the underlying concepts easier to grasp, employ glyphs to communicate complex temporal information and colors to make it possible to understand the connection between the two views (Topological View and Temporal View) available in the system. In this paper, we present the design ideas behind AsbruView, and discuss its usefulness based on the results of a usability study we performed with six physicians."

		"abstract": "Medical therapy planning shares a number of properties of project management. It is, however, different in a few very important aspects — most notably, the more complex notion of time it requires. Asbru is a language that can represent medical therapy plans in terms of time-oriented, skeletal plans. But due to its formal nature, it cannot be used directly by physicians. Therefore, we developed a visualization and user interface to deal with plans defined in Asbru, which can deal with most of its complexity. We present this interface (called AsbruView), and discuss its features and advantages over the two representations typically used in project management: Gantt and PERT charts."

		"pages": "1041–1051",
		"abstract": "Practical planning systems for real-world environments imply a striking challenge, because the planning and visualization techniques available are not that straightforwardly applicable. Skeletal plans are an effective way to reuse existing domain-specific procedural knowledge, but leave room for execution-time flexibility. However, the basic concepts of skeletal plans are not sufficient in our medical domain. First, the temporal dimensions and variability of plans have to be modelled explicitly. Second, the compositions and the interdependencies of different plans are not lucid to medical domain experts. The aim of our paper is to overcome these limitations and to present an intuitive user interface to the plan-representation language Asbru. We explored different representations and developed a powerful plan visualization, called AsbruView. AsbruView consists of two views, first, a topological view, which utilizes the metaphor graphics of “running tracks” and “traffic” and, second, a temporal view, which utilizes the idea of LifeLines."

Therefore, a powerful user interface is needed. We identify the key problems the user-interface designer is faced with, and present a number of \"classic\" solutions and their shortcomings, which led to our own solution called AsbruView. Its two different views (Topological View and Temporal View) are presented."

The main drawbacks are that the compositions and the interdependencies of different skeletal plans and their components are not lucid. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations and to present the visualization of time-oriented, skeletal plans. Within the Asgaard project, we have developed a time-oriented and intention-based language, called Asbru, to represent such skeletal plans. The Asbru syntax is defined in Backus-Naur form (BNF). Reading BNF or similar forms are next to impossible even for domain experts. We explored different representations and automated knowledge-acquisition tools. However, the domain experts did not accept any of these representations. Consequently, we investigated different metaphor graphics and ended up with a plan visualization utilizing the metaphors of tracks and traffic, called AsbruView. We formatively evaluated different approaches of this plan visualization with physicians applying treatment protocols of mechanical ventilated newborn infants."
