### <a href="/blog/2014/1-quilt-plots">Peer Review, Part 1: Quilt Plots</a>
What is peer review? How does it work? And is it really as flawed as people claim it is? In this little series, I will talk about all that, and then end up arguing that peer review does, in fact, work - at least in visualization.
