### <a href="/blog/2022/site-changes-coming-how-to-follow-sites-and-where-ive-been">Site Changes Coming, How to Follow Sites, and Where I've Been</a>
This site has been around for over 16 years now, and a lot has changed in the world during that time. I'm currently working on an overhaul and wanted to give everybody an idea of what I'm thinking about and why there has been little activity. In light of recent developments, here are also some good ways to follow good old-fashioned blogs and an alternative to Twitter. _<a href="/blog/2022/site-changes-coming-how-to-follow-sites-and-where-ive-been">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2021/eagereyes-turns-15">EagerEyes Turns 15</a>
EagerEyes is 15 years old today! Rather than look back at 15 years of visualization and blogging (though I will do a little of that too), I want to reflect a bit on what blogging means today and where things are going. _<a href="/blog/2021/eagereyes-turns-15">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2019/xiii">XIII</a>
This website is now thirteen years old. While it has slowed down somewhat recently, it’s still alive and kicking. Now in its teens, it is looking for new experiences and trying out new things. _<a href="/blog/2019/xiii">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/a-decade-of-eagereyes">A Decade of EagerEyes</a>
So here we are. 10 years. A decade. 3653 days. 452 postings. Some good stuff. Some bad stuff. Some terrible stuff. A decade is a long time. But its end is also just the beginning of the next one. _<a href="/blog/2016/a-decade-of-eagereyes">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-origin-story">The EagerEyes Origin Story</a>
Have you ever wondered where the weird name comes from, what the site was like before it was a blog, and how it all got started? This posting has all the answers. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-origin-story">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/why-i-do-this">Why I Do This</a>
Why spend countless hours writing a blog like this? What do I get out of it? What do I hope to accomplish? What is the purpose? _<a href="/blog/2016/why-i-do-this">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/meet-the-new-logo-and-theme">Meet the New Logo and Theme!</a>
This site has gone through many different looks and designs. I haven't kept count, but I'd be surprised if it was fewer than ten. So far, they have all either been off-the-shelf generic designs or ones I had created myself. For its tenth birthday, I decided to splurge and get eagereyes a complete makeover: a new theme and a real, custom logo. _<a href="/blog/2016/meet-the-new-logo-and-theme">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-controversies">The Controversies</a>
I have opinions. I state those opinions. Not everybody likes my opinions. And sometimes it's not just a matter of opinion, but also of tone and approach. Criticism can be a useful tool or it can be an angry attack. Figuring out which is which isn't always easy while you're doing it. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-controversies">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/blogstravaganza">The Ten Years of EagerEyes Blogstravaganza</a>
October 1 marks the ten-year anniversary of this website. Well, it’s really older than that, but the first posting in its modern history is dated October 1, 2006. To celebrate, this week will see a posting every day, so hold on to your hats! _<a href="/blog/2016/blogstravaganza">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/introducing-shift-register-my-new-electronics-blog">Introducing Shift Register, My New Electronics Blog</a>
I have started a new blog, which I call shift register. It's about electronics projects I'm doing, mostly building circuits on breadboards and playing with Arduinos. _<a href="/blog/2016/introducing-shift-register-my-new-electronics-blog">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2014/eagereyes-will-be-bloggier-in-2015">eagereyes will be bloggier in 2015</a>
I always mess with my site around the new year, and this year is no exception. In addition to a new theme, I've also been thinking about content. Here are some thoughts on what I want to do in 2015. _<a href="/blog/2014/eagereyes-will-be-bloggier-in-2015">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2014/eight-years-of-eagereyes">Eight Years of eagereyes</a>
What is the purpose of blogging about visualization? Is it to make fun of the bad stuff? Is it to point to pretty things? Is it to explain why things are good or bad? Is it to expand the landscape of ideas and break new ground? Or is it to discuss matters at great length that ultimately don't matter all that much? _<a href="/blog/2014/eight-years-of-eagereyes">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2013/seven-year-itch">The Seven Year Itch</a>
Eagereyes.org turned seven years old last week, on October 1st. Seven years is a long time on the web. In dog years, the site is almost fifty years old! Has it lost its edge? Have I gone soft? Where is the bite? Where is the fight? _<a href="/blog/2013/seven-year-itch">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2013/eagereyes-google-reader">How to Keep Following eagereyes After the End of Google Reader</a>
With Google Reader shutting down July 1st, now is the time to find alternative ways to follow your favorite blogs. For this one, you can now get new postings on Facebook and through a dedicated Twitter feed, in addition to the RSS feed. See below for some RSS aggregator/reader alternatives to Google Reader. _<a href="/blog/2013/eagereyes-google-reader">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2012/posting-frequency-2012">New Posting Frequency for 2012</a>
In my enthusiasm about switching to WordPress, I made the mistake of tweeting about potentially increasing my posting frequency in 2012. While I have tried to stick to a roughly weekly schedule in the past, there have been weeks when I did not write anything. My hope is to increase the frequency to roughly twice a week and see how that goes. John Peltier and Jorge Camoes are planning on doing the same. _<a href="/blog/2012/posting-frequency-2012">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2012/why-i-switched-drupal-wordpress">Why I Switched From Drupal to WordPress</a>
After more than five years, switching the content management system (CMS) on eagereyes was not an easy decision. I've been thinking about doing that for a while though, and I want to explain my reasons and what I expect WordPress to do better than Drupal below. This should also be useful for anybody who is on the fence about starting a blog (or has a blog that hasn't been updated in a while). _<a href="/blog/2012/why-i-switched-drupal-wordpress">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2011/new-series">New Series: Watchlist</a>
Some of the most exciting work in our field is done by up-and-coming doctoral students, post-docs, and junior faculty members. In a new semi-regular series, I will highlight some of the people whose work I find particularly interesting and promising. The goal is to get their names onto people's radars earlier than this would have otherwise happened, in particular for those individuals who don't make a lot of noise about their work. _<a href="/blog/2011/new-series">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2011/five-years-of-eagereyes">Five Years of EagerEyes</a>
In dog years, this website is now (almost) as old as I am. Over the years, it has changed both its direction and design several times; there have been times when I was overwhelmed with my readers' reactions and times when nobody seemed to read the stuff I wrote. While I generally hate “best of” postings and indulging in nostalgia, I want to look back at a few of the things that I believe have shaped this site and how I think about what I'm doing, and revisit a few of the more interesting and/or successful things I've managed to do and write over the years. _<a href="/blog/2011/five-years-of-eagereyes">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2010/why">Why Am I Doing This, Again?</a>
Today marks the fourth anniversary of this humble little website. I've spent countless hours writing, designing, arguing, and thinking about the things that I publish here. What others may consider a waste of time has helped me tremendously to make new connections, meet new people, refine my thinking, and broaden my horizons. If you're not running a website (or blog), you're really losing out. _<a href="/blog/2010/why">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2008/two-years-of-eagereyes">Two Years of EagerEyes</a>
This site turns two today. There have been frantic periods of posting and periods of silence. There have been times when I thought nobody would read this and times when I had more than 50,000 visitors in a day. Here is a bit of history, some thoughts on what the site has accomplished, and what I am planning for the future. _<a href="/blog/2008/two-years-of-eagereyes">Read more…</a>_
