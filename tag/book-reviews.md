# Book Reviews

### <a href="/blog/2019/review-alberto-cairo-how-charts-lie">Review: Alberto Cairo, How Charts Lie</a>
Alberto Cairo’s new book, How Charts Lie, takes readers on a tour of how charts are used and misused, and teaches them how to not be misled. It’s a useful book for both makers and consumers of charts, in the news, business, and pretty much anywhere else. _<a href="/blog/2019/review-alberto-cairo-how-charts-lie">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2017/review-putting-stories-to-work-and-out-on-the-wire">Review: Putting Stories to Work and Out On the Wire</a>
Two books I’ve read recently make good points about stories that apply to data stories, without the books being about data: Shawn Callahan’s Putting Stories to Work and Jessica Abel’s Out On the Wire. _<a href="/blog/2017/review-putting-stories-to-work-and-out-on-the-wire">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/review-jon-schwabish-better-presentations">Review: Jon Schwabish, Better Presentations</a>
Presentations can be dreadful. Badly thought-out slides, boring structure, poorly delivered. I once told a colleague after a practice talk to please shoot me before she’d ever make me sit through such a talk again (to be fair, she had called the talk boring herself before she even began). _<a href="/blog/2016/review-jon-schwabish-better-presentations">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/review-lupi-posavec-dear-data">Review: Lupi, Posavec, Dear Data</a>
Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec have turned their Dear Data project into a book. It's a great example of the kind of creative work you can do around visualization without computers, entirely by hand. What started with a simple idea turned into an amazing project. _<a href="/blog/2016/review-lupi-posavec-dear-data">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2015/review-munroes-thing-explainer-and-pinkers-sense-of-style">Review: Munroe's Thing Explainer and Pinker's Sense of Style</a>
Bad writing and the inability to explain in terms normal people can understand are the hallmarks of academic writing. Here are two books every academic should read and take to heart to be able to recognize bad prose and learn how to fix it. _<a href="/blog/2015/review-munroes-thing-explainer-and-pinkers-sense-of-style">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2014/review-kraak-mapping-time">Review: Kraak, Mapping Time</a>
Can you write an entire book about a single chart? Even if that chart is supposedly the best one ever? Menno-Jan Kraak's new book, Mapping Time: Illustrated by Minard's Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812, discusses the historical context of Minard's work, his, life, and walks through a number of design exercises to show the same or similar data in different ways. _<a href="/blog/2014/review-kraak-mapping-time">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2014/review-manuel-lima-the-book-of-trees">Review: Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees</a>
Trees. They’re everywhere. And not just in the physical world, but in data visualization and knowledge representation as well. This is not a new phenomenon, it goes back thousands of years. Manuel Lima’s new book, The Book of Trees, gives an overview. _<a href="/blog/2014/review-manuel-lima-the-book-of-trees">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2013/review-isabel-meirelles-design-information">Review: Isabel Meirelles, Design for Information</a>
When I’m asked for a good book about visualization, I usually try to change the subject. There is no book I really love, they all have their issues. But thanks to Isabel Meirelles, I can now give a straight answer: Design for Information. _<a href="/blog/2013/review-isabel-meirelles-design-information">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2013/review-chabris-simons-invisible-gorilla">Review: Chabris, Simons, The Invisible Gorilla</a>
Inattentional and change blindness are two fascinating phenomena that more people should be aware of. The Invisible Gorilla describes them as well as some other interesting and surprising psychological research. _<a href="/blog/2013/review-chabris-simons-invisible-gorilla">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2013/review-scott-christianson-100-diagrams-changed-world">Review: Scott Christianson, 100 Diagrams That Changed the World</a>
I recently came across this book that claims to collect the 100 most important diagrams in the history of mankind. It’s a good collection, with many wonderful examples, though it has its flaws. _<a href="/blog/2013/review-scott-christianson-100-diagrams-changed-world">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2012/review-alberto-cairo-functional-art">Review: Alberto Cairo, The Functional Art</a>
When Alberto Cairo first told me about the book he was writing, called The Functional Art, he warned me that only a small part of it was going to be about visualization. I have no idea what he was talking about, the book I read was a visualization book from start to finish. It is one of the most interesting and insightful books on the topic I have read in a while. _<a href="/blog/2012/review-alberto-cairo-functional-art">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2012/review-visualize-visual-complexity-science-magazine">My Review of Visualize This and Visual Complexity for Science Magazine</a>
I was asked to write a review of two recent visualization books for Science: Nathan Yau's Visualize This and Manuel Lima's Visual Complexity. The piece appeared in the last issue of 2011, right before Christmas. Below is a link and some additional comments on the review and the two books. _<a href="/blog/2012/review-visualize-visual-complexity-science-magazine">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2010/review-steven-johnson-the-ghost-map">Review: Steven Johnson, The Ghost Map</a>
John Snow's map of the cholera dead after London's 1854 epidemic is often heralded as one of the earliest examples of graphical data analysis. Steven Johnson's The Ghost Map gives a lot of background about the London of the 1850s, Snow's work, and how central the map really was. _<a href="/blog/2010/review-steven-johnson-the-ghost-map">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2010/kaiser-fung-numbers-rule-your-world">Review: Kaiser Fung, Numbers Rule Your World</a>
You all know what statistics is, right? I mean, everybody knows. But if you had to explain why it's useful, and what it's useful for, would you have an answer? Do you know how statistics makes a difference in all our lives, all the time? Even if you (think you) do, check out Kaiser Fung's book, Numbers Rule Your World. _<a href="/blog/2010/kaiser-fung-numbers-rule-your-world">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2010/cornelia-dean-am-i-making-myself-clear">Review: Cornelia Dean, Am I Making Myself Clear?</a>
The first episode of season 4 of Mad Men opens with Don Draper being interviewed by a journalist. He doesn't tell him anything that's of interest and then dodges the question Who is Don Draper? by claiming that he was taught as a child not to talk about himself. Scientists do an equally terrible job at communication, and for many of the same reasons. Cornelia Dean's book Am I Making Myself Clear? offers fascinating insights into both journalism and science, and provides concrete ideas for how to do better. _<a href="/blog/2010/cornelia-dean-am-i-making-myself-clear">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking">Book Review: Visual Thinking for Design, by Colin Ware</a>
Colin Ware's latest book Visual Thinking for Design has a promising subtitle: active vision, attention, visual queries, gist, visual skills, color, narrative, design. That's covering quite a bit of ground, and also a lot of things not usually considered in visualization. While this is a book about design, I was interested in what it could teach people in InfoVis, and I review it from that point of view. _<a href="/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking">Read more…</a>_
