> _Data visualization research focuses on data exploration and analysis, yet the vast majority of visualizations people see were created for a different purpose: presentation. Whether we are talking about charts showing data to help make a presenter’s point, data visuals created to accompany a news story, or the ubiquitous infographics, many more people consume charts than make them.The techniques used to present data are mostly those used in analysis: bar charts, line charts, and so on. Although we understand them well, that understanding is based on their role in analysis. What if the presentation goals were different? How would that impact how the techniques we used? And are there techniques uniquely suited to data presentation but not necessarily as ideal for exploration and analysis?_
