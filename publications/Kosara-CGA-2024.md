title: "Business Data Visualization, Beyond the Boring"
description: "Business uses of charts and visualizations, and by extension business users, are usually considered mundane and boring. But they, too, want to get their audience's attention, emphasize a point they're making, or simply break out of the monotony of the limited palette of common chart types. I believe that there is ample opportunity to develop new approaches and build better tools that go far beyond the current one-size-fits-all approach to creating charts - much more than is currently recognized in the visualization community. The first step is to reexamine our notions of who business users are, and what they actually want and need."
