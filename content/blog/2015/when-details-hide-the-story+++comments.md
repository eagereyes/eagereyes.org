>	Good post. I like the WSJ graphic. You make a good point about the smoothing issue, but that aside, I think it does a great job communicating the information. In sone respects your bar chart is better. It captures the growth trend well, but it misses the growing frequency of outbreaks. Those small orange circles leading up to the big explosion are an important piece of the story.
