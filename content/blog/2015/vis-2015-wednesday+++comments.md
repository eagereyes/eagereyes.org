In 2004, I organized an early panel on unsolved problems in VIS that Robert Laramee was kind enough to note in the abstract for his panel at VIS 2015.  So, here is my viewpoint on some of your notions and I regret that I did not hear the panelists first hand.

>	Robert Laramee's and his panel team are recognizing an important evolution in the field of Visualization that has begun to take place.  This field and even the IEEE VIS conference is over 25 years old now.  The subfield of SciVis, the oldest of the subfields, may perhaps be the first in recognizing this transition into very teachable or solved problems problems in visualization.  Penny Rheingans' listing is a good summary for recognizing this evolution of the field of visualization.  However, Tamara Munzner's recent text book on Visualization Analysis and Design is also a recognition that there are some fundamental principals of visualization that can now be put down as solved problems or as key approaches in a text book that aspiring students of visualization can learn about. Prior to this phase, there were no visualization textbooks and body of solved visualization problems.  Rather, we provided students with selected readings of visualization research papers along with providing a fundamental text in computer graphics or maybe statistics to guide those trying to enter the field of visualization or visual analytics.

I think there are likely to be many individuals who may want to develop mobile apps from user viewpoints in regard to personal visualization. 
>	
>	Again, I was not at the panel but I commend  Robert Laramee and his panelists for benchmarking an important aspect of the maturation of the visualization field.  I also am not surprised the SciVis community would sense this transition first as SciVis is the oldest subfield of visualization.
