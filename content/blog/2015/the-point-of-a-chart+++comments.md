>	I agree on this one. Since we are using graph or charts to give visual impacts to the audience, let's just do it in the right way. There different types of charts or graphs for different agenda and delivery of the data. A right pick of your type will serve its purpose exponentially. Also, you should know how to use colors on them. And I must say, the discussion in your article is very clear for understanding. It is commendable...
