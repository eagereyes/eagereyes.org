>	Yes a great conversation! I immediately started thinking the data-ink ration as well. But then there is the emergence of complications as intellectual triggers that engage system 1 cognition versus the system 2 heuristic. Complications might be an opportunity. I prefer clean aesthetics but I might prefer them because I do not have to think about them. Maybe we want to pull the think trigger sometimes.

>	another interesting reason for using this term is that complications is what drives the price of fine watches up. if clockmakers can fit a number of complications in a very space constrained watch, this is a feat of virtuosity and the watch, a grande complication, becomes a work of art. for us in the visualization or ux space, since there are much fewer technical limitations, there is typically no value in adding unwanted features - it is not impressive to do so. however, if we consider the constraint of a display to be: balance, legibility, ease of use, elegance; and the novelty to be: not necessarily an additional feature, but a different way to represent the information, then yes, these new displays are very much like fine complications.
