>	Thank you for your comments. A friend pointed out this post to me. I am in the publishing industry and I am truly ashamed of the state of affairs. We are "typesetters". Yes, as old fashioned as the name suggests! We are also trying to create a tool that takes the pain out of authoring. Would love to get your feedback on it...

An editor for documents that are long, have global and local structures, are internal and external referencing will only come from the research community itself. Bugs and all. Sigh.

>	I fully agree, Andrew. Problem is word processors in general – and of course all have been killed off by the worst of all!! The author should not be seeing pages at all when writing. What is needed is something like a blog post editor, which saves text in a structured way.

>	I disagree. It may be basic--headers, indents, tabs and paragraphs--but you'll see most writers do simple formatting akin to typewriter formatting while they are recording their thoughts electronically. Do a simple clean up from someone unfamiliar with a word processing program, and one sees the limitations of thinking that writing is separate from formatting.

For word processing, I'll continue to use Word because despite its limitations, I know I'm creating a document that I can share with others. (I'm not doing citations in volume anymore, so I'm thrilled to be done with citation management.)

>	Thanks for this insightful article. It really covered a lot in reviewing different paper writing software. This matter should really be taken into consideration with serious intention. And I appreciate your courage to draw out your experiences with these software. At least, people can identify themselves with what you felt. I hope this could help a lot of writers...

>	It is amazing that no one here has mentioned Word Perfect. It is the most intuitive word processor still, and much more flexible than MS Word. If you are worried about being able to share, WP can always be saved as a Word file or an .rtf file, making your writing accessible to others.
