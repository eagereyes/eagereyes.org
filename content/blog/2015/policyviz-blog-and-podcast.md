# Link: PolicyViz Blog and Podcast

Jon SchwabishÂ is running a blog and podcast called <a href="https://policyviz.com">PolicyViz</a>. In both, he talks about communicating data and how to deal with numbers for the general public. He recently had two interesting guests back-to-back on his podcast: Nigel Holmes and Edward Tufte. Both episodes are well worth listening to.
