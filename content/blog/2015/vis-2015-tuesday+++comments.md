>	Hi Robert: Thanks for covering the color panel in your eager eyes blog. I am still in the hospital &amp; it was good to know from an outside source that the panel was well received. I think people like color &amp; it is that simple as to why people use it in their digital media. The challenge is how to use it effectively so that others can appreciate the visualization as well. I have a simple pie chart example I will try to send to you &amp; your blog later. Thank you again. Smiles...Theresa-Marie

>	Hi Robert:  I have posted my study of a color wheel in Red Yellow Blue painters color space (Red, Yellow, Blue, Orange, Green and Purple colors) with a color deficiency study using Vischeck: http://theresamarierhyne.com/Theresa-Marie_Rhynes_Viewpoint/Blog/Entries/2015/11/3_Color_Wheel_and_Color_Deficiency.html
