# Link: Data Stories Podcast 2014 Review

<a href="http://datastori.es/data-stories-46-year-2014-review-w-robert-kosara-and-andy-kirk/">Episode 46 of the <em>Data Stories</em> podcast</a> features <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com">Andy Kirk</a> and yours truly in <del>an epic battle for podcast dominance</del> a review of the year 2014. This complements well my <a title="The State of Information Visualization, 2015" href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2015/the-state-of-information-visualization-2015">State of Information Visualization</a> posting, and of course there is a bit of overlap (I wrote that posting after we recorded the episode – Moritz and Enrico are <em>so slow</em>). There are lots of differences though, and the podcast has the advantage of not just me talking. We covered a lot of ground there, starting from a general down about the year, to end up finding quite a few things to talk about (just check out the long list of links in the show notes!).
