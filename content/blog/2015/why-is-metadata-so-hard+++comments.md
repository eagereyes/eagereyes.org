>	I love your post, and you said it better than I could ever have. In my field of epidemiology, we have a very bad case of "lack of metadata". Even the best datasets by the CDC sometimes lack clear metadata beyond the items you describe (unclear data dictionary, SAS format labels, etc.). You well-describe how these simple items are a start but ultimately inadequate.

>	1.  First, Gliffy (www.gliffy.com) is a great tool for diagramming data flows. For example, I selected individuals with periodontitis from the NHANES dataset, and I used Gliffy to show how I excluded and included people into the analytic dataset.
>	2.  Second, while it is good to use an automated tool to start a data dictionary, please put humanly-written definitions into this dictionary.  As you point out, Mr. Kosara, having the dictionary in spreadsheet format is far superior to PDF.
>	3.  In the data dictionaries, don't just document the main datasets, but also, document the picklists - their levels and definitions.  (You ask, "Why store numbers and not strings only?" and the answer in my field is that SAS, R, and SPSS don't handle strings as easily as numbers.) In a production database, note when fields were invented and retired, and why.
>	4. Finally, think of metadata as "data curation". Just because we have a few representations (data flow, dictionary, etc.) doesn't mean we can't benefit from more. For example, if someone writes a report on a case definition in your dataset, put that with the metadata for someone to read it later if they want to use those fields.

>	This is why I like your post so much - it applies to all of us! Thank you very much for putting these ideas out there.
