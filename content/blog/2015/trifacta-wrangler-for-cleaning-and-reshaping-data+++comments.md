>	Traditionally, reshaping means transforming data from wide to long or long to wide format in statistical software such as Stata, SAS or SPSS based on key variables for different set of analysis (t-test require wide format and repeated measures analysis entail a long format). I haven't seen any such operations performed by Trifacta in any manual or in the video shared so far.
