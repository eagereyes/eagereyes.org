# Link: The Graphic Continuum

<em><a href="http://policyviz.com/graphic-continuum/">The Graphic Continuum</a></em> is a poster created by <a href="http://policyviz.com/">Jon Schwabish</a> and Severino Ribecca (the man behind the <em><a href="http://www.datavizcatalogue.com">Data Visualisation Catalogue</a></em>). It lists almost 90 different chart types and organizes them into five large groups: distribution, time, comparing categories, geospatial, part-to-whole, and relationships. Some of them are connected across groups where there are further similarities.

The poster is printed very nicely and makes for a great piece of wall art to stare at when thinking about data, and maybe to get an idea for what new visualization to try.
