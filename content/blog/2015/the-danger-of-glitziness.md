Wayne Lytle created this video about the <em>Viz-O-Matic</em> that provides lots of tools to make visualization glitzier. It's a nice little spoof, and a throwback to the computer graphics of the early 1990s (it was made for SIGGRAPH 1993). This video was brought up in a discussion about storytelling at CHI last week, though I don't think that its lessons are very deep on that subject.
