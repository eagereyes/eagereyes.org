>	Spot on with the characterization of academic talks!! Any talk should be a sales pitch of your ideas, your work and/or your agenda.  Sounds bad to call it a sales pitch but a talk is about convincing your audience that what you have to say is worth listening to. Not to trivialize it, but being entertaining is huge part. A boring presentation is a lost opportunity.  This carries over in a big way to the visualization world too. If it is not engaging then few will use it and only under duress.
