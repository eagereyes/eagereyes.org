# Encounters with HCI Pioneers

Ben Shneiderman has put together a series of postings about the <a href="https://hcipioneers.wordpress.com/">Pioneers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</a>. Each includes a brief biography, some personal notes by Ben, as well as Ben's photos of them. The latter are particularly remarkable, often going back to the 1980s – like the gem at the top of this page, showing the man himself in 1986.
