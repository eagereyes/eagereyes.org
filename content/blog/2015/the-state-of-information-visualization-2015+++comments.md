In 2013, Periscopic's Gun Deaths (and yes, I know this came out at the end of December 2012, but it picked up speed in the early part of the year) and Pitch Interactive's Drones viz both seemed to be things that we all talked about. This year? Selfiecity maybe? (though with all due respect to the authors, it's clearly not as an important topic as the Periscopic or Pitch projects).

The new media places like Vox and 538 seem to dominate the discussion these days and, as you note, not always for positive reasons. But those two at least are not doing dramatic data visualization pieces (Vox in particular seems to just take graphs from others and repackage them). Upshot may be doing a bit more on this front--both Nathan and Andy put the "How the Recession Reshaped the Economy, in 255 Charts" at the top of the list (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/05/upshot/how-the-recession-reshaped-the-economy-in-255-charts.html?&amp;_r=1&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1), but again, are any of them visualizations that the field as a whole is talking about? I'm not so sure.
