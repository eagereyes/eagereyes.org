Why not use a nice big day counter, and put the 'miles checked in per day' at the bottom? (I know: placing it below the n-th day is to far down for your taste). Might a day counter with 'miles checked in' as a single small number (no graph) work better?

>	Good points, and yes, I'm definitely looking for thoughts and suggestions! I agree that the very top is not ideal, but I can't find a better spot. It's meant to be a bit of a progress indicator, so putting it at the very bottom means it's almost invisible. And putting it below the big chart breaks the continuity with the other charts.
