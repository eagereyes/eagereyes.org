# New eagereyesTV Video and Series: Chart Appreciation

Time to breathe new life into my little YouTube channel, which I'm calling eagereyesTV. I'm doing so with the start of a new series I'm calling <em>Chart Appreciation</em>. Each episode will be on one particular visualization, news piece, or interactive. As the first one, I picked Hannah Fairfield's <em>Driving Safety, in Fits and Starts</em> from 2012.

This is one of my favorite charts ever and it uses the connected scatterplot, a technique I have a special fondness for. So it seemed like a good starting point for this new series. I put a lot more work into the animations than I have ever before, and have also generally upped my game in terms of editing, as well as video and sound quality. The video is actually in 4K, so if you have the required hardware you can enjoy it at full resolution!

As usual, you can watch it on YouTube or directly here. Though I would really appreciate it if you could <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftqNuw9H7h8">head over to YouTube</a> to subscribe to the channel or maybe even give the video a thumbs-up!

<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/17/science/driving-safety-in-fits-and-starts.html"><em>Driving Safety, in Fits and Starts</em></a> can be found on the New York Times website. The <a href="/papers/the-connected-scatterplot-for-presenting-paired-time-series" data-type="post" data-id="9076">paper about the connected scatterplot</a> I mention towards the end is work with Steven Franconeri and Steve Haroz from 2016. 

I obviously intend to make more videos in this series, and in general (since the channel has been dormant for a while). I'd appreciate any comments and thoughts you have, positive orâ€¦ constructive. I've put an absurd amount of work into this video, so I hope somebody finds it interesting.
