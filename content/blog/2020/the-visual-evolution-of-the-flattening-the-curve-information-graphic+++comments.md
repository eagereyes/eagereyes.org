I think it important to be aware of that to temper uncritical contexts in which we share visualizations (I'm not suggesting you are doing that Robert, but I think there are many who have with various flatten the curve examples).

I disagree and think there are details there that are critically important. In particular, versions that show approximately equal areas under both curves imply this is just about temporal spreading. To have an unskewed normal distribution for the unchecked curve implies herd immunity is responsible for the reduction. This in turn implies a vertical scale that encompasses the majority of a circulating population (somewhere in the range 50-80%). Combine this with a health capacity line that is somewhere around half the peak, is a major assumption that I struggle to find evidence for at the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is quite possible that that dashed line for many countries (including the US and UK) could, in reality, be very near the bottom of the y-axis. Even though these are 'schematic' charts, we have to take care in what they imply. For example, Joscha Bach shows a scenario where to flatten the curve below a typical health capacity ceiling might take over a decade - https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727 Of course the assumptions he makes are open to challenge, but the point being, so are the assumptions made in the more widely circulated charts. I don't think we can hide behind "it's just a schematic" when the outcomes of different assumptions are so radically different.

Strategies to flatten the curve to reduce peak demand may well be important at the population/policy level, but can we say it is equally important at the individual level? I suspect there are much stronger motivations for individual behaviour change. I wonder if part of the appeal of the graphic is that people simply get the idea, one that they had not previously considered and that there is some satisfaction in doing so.

>	Interesting, thanks! I do think that "it's just a schematic" is the reason why it's fine the way it is, though. There are lots of questions you can ask, the area is only one of them (and is it really the same or should be more or less?). You mention the total duration, but there's also the shape, it'll likely not be symmetrical. And it won't be nearly this smooth.

Maybe people just share it because it reinforces what they're already doing (or are perceiving to be the right thing). And it's not like it would be easy to test how much it influences people. But I'd be surprised if the reinforcement hadn't helped some percentage of the population take the measures like washing hands, social distancing, etc., more serious.
