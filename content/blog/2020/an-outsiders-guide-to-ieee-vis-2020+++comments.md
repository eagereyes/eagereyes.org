>	Thanks for the advice and info Robert. Several of my colleagues will be attending IEEE VIS for the first time.Your recommendations will be quite useful to them.. But mostly I want to thank you and recognize you for proper and correct use of time zones and daylight savings time (i.e. MDT). It drives me crazy when people and particularly learned organizations don't use daylight saving time and time zones correctly. (I'm looking at you ACM and IEEE.) Yes it's a pet peeve of mine. :-)

>	Thank you for the summary Robert. We are hoping that our Data Visualisation students will follow the proceedings this year and this is fantastic introduction. Also, I absolutely second your observations re Tina the virtual assistant. I absolutely hated the experience.
