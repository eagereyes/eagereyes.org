# Plot.io

<a href="http://www.plot.io/?lrRef=2AEnO">Data visualization startup Plot.io</a> has been making some noise lately. From what I know so far, it looks a lot like Tableau, but presumably works in the browser. This could be a potential <a title="The Rise and Fall of Swivel.com" href="/criticism/the-rise-and-fall-of-swivel">successor to Swivel</a>, which <a title="Swivel, Part 2: Solving A Single Problem" href="/criticism/swivel-part-2-solving-a-single-problem">folded a bit over a year ago</a>, and maybe what <a title="The End of Verifiable.com" href="/blog/2010/end-of-verifiable-com">Verifiable</a> was trying to do.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q904idCrY80">Their teaser video</a> is a bit confusing, but what it shows is an interface that looks a lot like Tableau. On <a href="http://twitter.com/plot_io">their Twitter feed</a>, they also talk about marks, and they seem to be aware of what is going on in the visualization community. They're certainly worth watching.
