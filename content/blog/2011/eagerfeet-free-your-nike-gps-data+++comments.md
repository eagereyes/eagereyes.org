>	The Nike+ technology is just amazing. That actually convinces you to start running and improve your performance. Its price is reasonably too and I like it.

Pete Davis says…
>	Worked great the first time, and I imported the gpx file straight into Dailymile.  The Nike + iPhone app gives me such great map data that I can't recreate on my own, because I run forest trails. Great app, bad website.  Nike is pretty strict with their data, so don't ever count on them making this easier for users :-)

>	Thank you SO much for this! My friend uses a Garmin and I use the Nike gps watch but we both wanted to use Map My Run together. Their gps watch is great, but I agree with you that the Nike site's flash is fun at first but clunky and annoying after a while. Your site worked perfectly and it was EASY to save my data as a gpx file and upload it to Map My Run. You rock.

Peter says…
>	Hi there.  Do you think you will be able to help me download historic run data from the current version of the Nike + website together with the GPS data?  I have given up on the Nike GPS product (too unreliable) and have opted for a Garmin.  Would love to be able to migrate the data to the Garmin website. Good work!  P

>	That's one of the most frustrating things about the current crop of fitness data sites - your data is locked up in private silos and it's challenging at best to get "your" data out if you want to play with it or upload it somewhere else.  GPX exporting is the current linqua franca for workout data, but hopefully more and more of these sites will start embracing open API formats that allow easier interactions with data.

>	One of the best truly "open" implementations I've found so far is http://openfitapi.com which offers fitness site operators a standard .JSON method for handling workout data.  I've used it for my own (fledgeling) workout site,  <a href="http://sufferhub.com" rel="nofollow">SufferHub</a> and am looking forward to developers and endusers taking advantage of this open data method.  Hopefully more and more fitness data sites adopt this way of thinking?

>	Probably, you've already heard that Nike Company stopped the service of their webpage. Therefore, I cannot transfer my tracks from the watch to Nike+ webpage. Do you have an idea how to get the data exported stored on the internal memory of the watch? Thanks a lot for your support.
