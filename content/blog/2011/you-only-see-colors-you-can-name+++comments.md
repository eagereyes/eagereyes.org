>	I think it's fair to say Russian lacks "blue" the same way Emglish lacks a word for... that hue of which red and pink are two examples. How do people who speak languages that do not (yet) distinguish between red and pink do, compared to English speakers who have the two words? 
>	
>	I say "yet" because English only acquired the word "pink" in the seventeenth century, naming the colour after the flower. "Orange" and I think "violet" come in about the same time, named after the fruit and the flower, respectively.

>	I've often thought we need a pithier single word in English for baby blue or sky blue, to replace the lame "blue modified by an adjective".

>	Robert, I really appreciate how you promote insight from other disciplines to improve the field of visualization. I commend you for it!

>	And yet, as a semanticist let me tell you that visualization as a field has only just begun to reach out in earnest to other disciplines. Quite frankly, the color perception research has been among the most influential data in semantics since the 70s!

>	Yes, categories go much, much deeper than what you even hint at in your blog post. There is so much more work to be read about categorical perception that could inform design choices. In fact, conflating the Sapir-Whorf debate with theories of the lexicon (that's the linguistic discipline dealing with how language entries and categories are stored in the brain) is rather unhelpful to that end.
>	
>	Speaking of color terms: color terms are not alike. Some colors are basal categories and others derivational subentries to that basal category. What constitutes a basal category is language specific and influences the way the derivational categories are perceived. It just so happens that English has 6 categories unlike other languages that have more or make do with just two ("light/dark" which is not the same as black/white, because red is then a subentry to "light"). Japanese has long before the Boroditsky paper been famous for placing blue and green in one category!  And yet, when you show a nonmetrosexual English male a mauve mallow (note that the name for the color is derivational of an object prototypically sporting the hue - if you know french it's more obvious) he is very well able to recognize it, even if he is much less able to distinguish it from other subcolors of the same category than to distinguish between categories.

>	Before I rant on about how words and concepts are different entities (you can express concepts for which your language does not have a word!) I'll just end with the conclusion: there is a great deal of interdisciplinary potential that is still untapped.

>	The colour blind do not necessarily differ in their descriptions or names of "colours". The "colours of the rainbow" are all there but not in the same width or depth. It is strange. My red is brown, I am told.

>	It could only interesting to ask why the Himba language divides up the color spectrum the way it does if it would be equally interesting and informative to ask the same question about English. But then, informative to what end?

>	This is where some people take the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis and depart sharply from linguistic and psychological research, and instead try to figure out how linguistic structures are actually reflections of the fundamental nature of a culture.  Typically, these attempts are over-simplistic, and suspiciously re-enforce the stereotypes which pre-existed the linguistic "evidence". 
>	
>	You, in fact, did not say that the *Himba people* are pragmatically concerned with the function of things, which is good. For most people, though, the distinction between a language and the people who speak it is not a very clear one, and I'm concerned that your proposal is easily misread as a cultural or racial generalization, which would be unfounded.

>	I found it interesting that you posted a picture saying that girls will have a higher color vocabulary than guys because this obviously shows that you play into gender roles or stereotypes. I believe that both girls and guys can have a low or high color vocabulary based on how they are raised. I also did not know that Russian language had no general word for the basic color "blue" but they named blue by lighter and darker shades of the English color "blue".

>	1. A very interesting topic!
>	2. Russians have 3 names for blue eyes.Maybe a native speaker can explain more. For light blue eyes they use either "golubye" or "serye" tha latter meaning greysh light blue. For deep blue eyes they use "sinie", especially in poems or fairy tales. 9Mention must be made that I am a Romanian speaker).
>	3. I was very amazed when I learned the word "bluebell" since I saw this flower was purple.(In Romanian the term is violet or mauve like in French). Then I read that , initially, English speakers did not possess another word for the real colour of the respective flower.

>	Having names for colours simply allows us to form a map to differentiate between colours when we have a choice. I mean, if you only have three labels, red, green and blue, you can't really label any other colours. That doesn't mean you can see the difference between red and orange, you just don't have a name.
>	
>	The idea that names are required presumes it is the label itself that trains the brain to improve differentiation of hues rather than the inherent learning from spending time training to identify the differences between colours.
>	
>	So I would like to see a test showing what happens when you attempt to train someone to differentiate colours by giving them the choice of being equal to one of two colours, or how far in between the colours the compared colour sits.
