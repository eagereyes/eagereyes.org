>	I want to point out that "That view is based on the things and the tools they are used to: static images, lots of number crunching and statistical testing, and R." might be a comparably bad misrepresentation of statistical graphics than the Chris Rock effect, in particular when you read Gelman's work about model checks using graphics.

>	Also, it seems to me that you're setting up a strawman in the "Tukey-Tufte school of thinking". At least where Tukey is concerned, his book is pretty seriously about interactive graphics. To give him crap in the context of the tools available at the time is exactly as bad as giving Bertin crap about his writings.

>	I just now saw Gelman's <a href="http://statisticsforum.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/infovis-vs-statgraphics-a-clear-example-of-their-different-goals/">second posting</a>. Ugh. Claiming that infographics is infovis is just an equally bad strawman.

>	At first I was skeptical about the spiral. It's not particularly good for rigorously quantitative analysis. But as a tool for exploration, it's capable of showing where questions should be asked.

>	With the tools easily at my own disposal, I would make the line charts, I'd average by week and by month, I'd look at moving averages, I'd plot just Mondays (etc.). I may even use something like loess with a short period to try to smooth away variability, and compare the actual data to smoothed representations. It takes time, but it also takes some time to analyze the spiral form. But perhaps the spiral makes it a bit easier to see details.

>	Is the underlying distinction here between using visualisation (however described) for communicating and/or illustrating something which is already known and using it to discover new information in the data. Just because a visualisation clearly shows an already known fact it can still have value in drilling home the message.

>	Unfortunately both sides seem to be comparing the best of one side with the worst of the other. There are some awful infovis papers that completely ignore utility in the pursuit of aesthetics. There are many awful stat graphics papers that ignore aesthetics in the pursuit of utility (and often fail to achieve that).  Neither side is perfect, and it's a shame that we can't work more closely together to get the best of both worlds.

>	Thanks for the kind words. I'd argue that currently most infovis and statistical researchers are missing one or more of the three components of the cycle needed for data analysis: data munging, data visualisation and data modelling. Statisticians tend to have great modelling tools, but not always the best visualisations. Infovis practitioners create compelling visualisations, but can lack models to help dig past the obvious patterns and look for subtleties.  Researchers in both fields tend to ignore the huge problem of getting your data in the right format to start with.

>	These are all generalisations - there are researchers in both fields doing fantastic work that combine all components. It's easy to construct straw-man arguments by picking the bad representatives.
