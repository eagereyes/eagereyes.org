>	Hi there. Nice post -- but that arrow. I wonder whether the arrow is doing harm. I don't know much about German football, but Robben is a winger so it's no surprise that he appears to spend much of the game up front. However, because it's not clear whether the data were rotated or translated to produce one image for the two halves of the game, we don't know for sure whether Robben favours the right or the left of the pitch. Taking the visualization at face value, it seems he favours the right. This makes sense, but it's rather ambiguous!

>	I agree that the 3D bar charts are sufferring from the "hiding" problem. One way to diminish it is to make the bar a bit transparent. But this brings another problem: the visualization looks very crowded because a lot of vertices are visible that should be hidden. And sometimes it is difficult to read the heights of some bars. So being transparent or opaque doesn't solve the entire problem.

>	On the other hand, I find heatmap doesn't have this problem at all. Of course, human eyes are better at telling height than colors apart. If we superimpose the real value on top of the color cells, this will not be a problem again.

However, I think bubble plot is more confusing (size, radius or diameter are proportional to the value?) and more difficult to be differentiated between close values.
