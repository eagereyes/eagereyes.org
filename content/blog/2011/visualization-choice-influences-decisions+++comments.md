>	Looks to me like one dataset, and Jorge is right about the mixup: the pies have switched data w.r.t. the other displays. (Look at the n= labels in the pies, and count the icons and get OCD with the bar charts.)

>	I think I'm not surprised that the table was most effective in showing how much better the new treatment is. For me, the iconic approach was worst, but partly is was because for a few moments I thought the crossed off boxes meant the patients died. The boxes looked too much like coffins lined up anyway.

>	I made a couple line charts showing success rate by prognosis and by treatment. I think either of these is more effective than any of the graphical approaches in this study. I think the one with Prognosis as the X axis would lead to immediate cessation of the experiment so that all patients could get the new treatment.

Robert Kosara says…
>	Those charts make sense (except for the y axis starting at 50% ;), but I'd still like to see the study that shows that they're more effective. The "coffins" may have been what lead to the strong results, which is why it would be important to test with other examples, not just ones that should be aborted.

>	I'm not too excited about the icon display either, but the whole point of this posting wast to show that personal preference and actual, measured effect don't always coincide.

<a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jon Peltier</a> says…
>	There's no study, I'm just expressing an opinion, based predominantly on my own first impressions of the charts in this study. Perhaps that's wrong of me, though, since I was confused by the icons at first (and I feel it's the worst display type of the four), while the study has found the icons most effective.
