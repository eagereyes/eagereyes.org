Of course, graphs and maps have always been around, but I am also happy to read that you pay special attention to not only the depiction of data but a way of letting the data be incorporated THROUGH the visual itself.

I believe in the depth of education you forecast, but it is absolutely crucial that enough infovis practitioners adhere to best practices in a field I'm tempted to call "statistical ethics". In other words, IF we can present the data AND explain its strengths and weaknesses relative to the questions at hand - ref. the URL above - THEN we have a chance to inform decisions in a positive way.
