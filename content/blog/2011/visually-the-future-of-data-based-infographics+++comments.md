>	Hello Robert, 
>	I very much agree that this development has at least the potential to become a game changer, which is why it is all the more important to take a critical look at how the game will be changed. I wrote a rather lengthy entry about design protocols and standards that develop through popularized tools and services. I think we can learn from the past if we look at the way similar tools have turned content creation from a niche to a mass market application. Perhaps we can avoid the mistakes that led to detrimental design practices. In my opinion Powerpoint is a great case study for this.

>	Hi
>	I hope the creation tool comes out sooner than later. Can think of many uses for this. What is not clear, as yet at least to me, is how the linkage between underlying data and the visualization will be accomplished. Both coupling and non-coupling have their pros and cons. Should probably revisit after the tool is released.
