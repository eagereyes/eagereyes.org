>	I just started reading this blog after a talk you gave last Friday, thanks for the great talk by the way. Ironically I was just talking to a friend about reducing the amount of opacity in a mark for cases where some dimension has a lot of variance. Although not exactly the same as blur, I think the affect would be pretty similar. I would question our abilities to measure levels of opacity in vertices in a graph, and be able to compare them, ie. one vertex has more variance in some dimension than another.

However, it does help with spatial relationships of 3D space in a 2D projected image (similar to how photography uses it).  Look for our (hopefully accepted) EuroVis paper on blur for volume rendering!
