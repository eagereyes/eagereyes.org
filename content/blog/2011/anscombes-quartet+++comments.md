If you are (only) looking for THE one correct/optimal model, you will probably miss a lot which contributes to the dataset.

>	Good write up on an important example of the power of visualizing of quantitative data graphically. The concept of using graphics was actually a hard sell 10-15 years ago. At the time Anscombe’s quartet was the most important example I had when arguing for graphics in performance analytics and dashboards. Now days the tides are changing with graphical visualizations everywhere. I now have engineers now chastising me when I provide textual data without any graphics! It's a refreshing change.
