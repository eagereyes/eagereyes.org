>	Robert, I think it is important to distinguish between the chart junk studied in the Bateman paper (i.e. embellishments that could make the information more memorable) and your run-of-the-mill, Excel-style chart junk (e.g. extra grid lines, background colors, excessive use of colors). I agree that the former can help in this narrow area of communicating simple bits of information. The latter makes any chart harder to read and never adds value. For me, putting both things under the same heading of chartjunk confuses the issue.

Robert Kosara says…
>	You're right in principle, I was really only thinking about embellishments, not grid lines or other things. However, I can imagine there being a potential trade-off as well that might reduce contrast or otherwise interfere with chart reading a bit, but still help set a chart apart from the others. But I think in most cases, it should be very easy to figure out which chart junk is unequivocally bad, and which might help memory.

>	This is a interesting and potential area of study - chart design based on what we are trying to achieve; presenting data that we would like to achieve, present data to motivate change, presenting analytical results,   presenting financial or other similar data, providing an overview on a subject,  mocking a certain point of view [ sarcastic comments as in the pie chart on gay marriage ]. All these categories may require different types of charts with  difference in junk and other aspects. One rule cannot fit all. That is certain. Now we need to define the rule for the other categories of onjectices.

Robert Kosara says…
>	I think the difference is that you don't always want to present the entire conclusion. The examples used in that study are a bit extreme in that way, the decorations could instead be based on the topic rather than the message. Also in either case, you'd still have some supporting evidence there, which might not only make the message stronger, but also more memorable as well (as opposed to being told "campaign costs are rising!").

>	Thanks, Robert, for your insightful revisitation of our paper. You have gotten to the crux of the matter in a way that many of the critiques have not: There is a place for non-data-ink in charts.  We were not careful enough in the paper (although we do mention it) to differentiate between charts made for analysis and charts made for information presentation.  The exemplar that inspired us was the USA Today graph, done much better by Holmes -- something designed very much to tell a story.  We admitted to ourselves that our charts in academic publications were trying to do exactly the same thing: convince our audience that our position, as described in the paper, was correct. So why were we relying on graphs and charts that would never, ever be used in publications that have this art down to a fine science?
>	
>	The key, then, was to determine whether properly designed charts that include chartjunk would interfere with comprehension -- a significant barrier to using them in academic or otherwise informative publications. The answer was, more or less, 'no'. Adding chartjunk does not really interfere with comprehension. It may interfere with analysis, but that's not the <i>purpose</i> of these charts. 
>	
>	The benefit, of course, is clear -- we remember things with stories attached.  If we create graphics with clear stories, emphasized with embellishments, people remember them.  
>	
>	I should mention that this study was three years in the making.  We tried numerous different versions and found little difference when we added non-data-ink that wasn't clearly chartjunk.  In other words, if we designed our plain graphs 'better' or even differently, we found no differences (much to our chagrin, since we had expected to find the data-ink ratio effect that Tufte hypothesizes in his work). It wasn't until we used chartjunk that told a story, that emphasized the meaning of the graph, that we saw a significant difference in memorability.
>	
>	Incidentally... we never did see a difference in interpretability or comprehension, although we did time trials and error tracking on a variety of different comprehension and interpretation tests on a wide variety of charts intended to present information (not to support analysis).  Of course, those are negative results and not easily publishable, but they're of interest for chart designers, I would think.
