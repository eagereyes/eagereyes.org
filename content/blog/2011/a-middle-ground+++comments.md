>	Nicely put. But why do we need a middle ground? Infographics and data visualization serve different masters. We don't need a one-size-fits-all perspective.

>	Available tools: Yes, opening the tools to naive users opens a Pandora's box.But limiting the options is, well, not an option. Perhaps Excel should have a sales pitch / data visualization switch button and let the users choose.

>	Beauty: (a sextist comment, sorry...) A chart without beauty is like a woman without makeup. Yes, it's easier to see her inner beauty if you bother to look twice. Too much makeup and you can't see the woman behind it. You need a makeup that enhances her beauty and makes her more attractive without changing her soul. Just like a chart.

>	Chart Types: Current chart types are 200 years old. We need new charts, but these charts must have a much better data/ink ratio than the old ones.Usually what happens is exactly the opposite.

>	Complexity: it's not a matter of complexity.A chart answers a question. If the question is simple, the answer don't have to be complex. And the other way around.

>	The two extremes that I have observed in the field is the precision of Rolf Hichert - www.hichert.com [ he restricts himself mostly to financial data] and the 'beautiful ' graphics of Mccandless.

>	Rolf computes the differences/ comparative numbers and displays these on the charts. Extremely useful in the area he operates. But would it be as effective in all / others fields - I believe not.

>	However, there is a large area in between - crisp precision is not the goal, an overview of the facts is enough. There are a number of areas where this is an effective alternative. One should not ignore this area, either. Not appropriate in all cases but useful in a number of context.
