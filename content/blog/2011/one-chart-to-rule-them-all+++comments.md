No need to interpolate sizes or wonder if they are scaled to diameter or area. Discrete bubble sizes is analogous to the distinct colors to show categories in the math charts.

>	Yes, I didn't quite finish that thought about dependent and independent variables. What I meant was that it makes more sense to me to show rate of change over a baseline of static values, rather than the other way around. You're probably right about the independent values, though.

>	I don't agree about size. It's quite easy to compare sizes, but it obviously gets more difficult the further apart the bubbles are (or the more there are that overlap). Also, town sizes aren't discrete numbers, unless you're only thinking of the order of magnitude (10,000, 100,000, etc.).

>	Apt comparison, very insightful. Outsiders have the same problem with both disciplines: they think it's far easier and faster than it is in reality. Anyone can write a sentence or draw a chart, but few can do it correctly.
