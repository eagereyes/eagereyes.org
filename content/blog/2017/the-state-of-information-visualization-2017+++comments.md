>	Hi Robert: 
>	
>	I very much like your reflections on Info Vis in 2016. I enjoy the courage you have in stating your opinions about directions in our field.
>	
>	 My unspoken dream over the last year was that eagereyes might formally recognize that my book on "Applying Color Theory to Digital Media and Visualization" was published in November 2016.  https://www.crcpress.com/Applying-Color-Theory-to-Digital-Media-and-Visualization/Rhyne/p/book/9781498765497
>	
>	I have admired your Blog for the 10 years it has been around. As I was writing my color book while recovering from my medical illness, I would dream of @eagereyes having a Blog post saying that my book was a good resource for covering the topic of colorizing visualizations.
>	
>	That is how important your Blog is to me.  It was also my window on IEEE VIS 2015 when I could not attend the event due to medical reasons. With much gratitude.
>	
>	So, I am shamelessly promoting my book here.  I hope that is ok with you and your readers.
