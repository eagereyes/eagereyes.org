>	the quick redesign isn't helpful because it excludes all the things that made the chart readable. the long titles, the unit descriptions, the bar labels, the value labels, the grid labels, etc. if you leave everything that matters out there is suddenly a lot of empty space to put in average lines and yet another label to explain what the line is.

>	Cool post, Robert. As much as I agree subjectively, I wonder if we can make this idea falsifiable. In a visualization, what kind of imprecision or judgement error or even speed difference would you expect with avg-as-bar vs avg-as-grid-line?

Perhaps the more important thing would be confidence, though: can I easily find the average and how sure do I feel about the difference? I'd be surprised if the line wasn't better at both.
