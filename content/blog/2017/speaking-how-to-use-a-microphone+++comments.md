>	Great article! I would also add that "lapel" or "lav" mic placement can be a little tricky. For best sound, they should be located over your sternum -- say between the second and third buttons down a collared shirt. Higher might seem better -- closer to your mouth -- but that can also place it in the shadow of your chin and cause it to be harder to understand. Similarly, if you literally attach it to a jacket lapel on one side, try to place it on the side you'll be looking towards most often -- the audience, the screen -- since a lecturer is often not symmetrically placed and only looking straight out into the audience.

They're expensive and easily damaged and not necessary for a parade of conference speakers. But to some degree "lapel" mics are outdated. For actors on stage, they'll often place the mic at the front of their hairline, hidden in their hair.)
