>	I agree that we need community efforts to make our voice heard by the rest of the world. I sometimes feel that many people outside the VIS community are looking for solutions that our VIS community already has (or has been working on for a while). My question is how we can bridge this gap. How can we make our VIS community more visible?

The first paper studies how to measure visualization literacy and the other paper investigates how to educate non-experts an unknown visualization online (parallel coordinates was used in this particular paper). I feel that I should write blog articles on this topic, too.
