I'm quite familiar with this material; also being a former curator of the Municipal Museum,The Hague, which does hold the complete oeuvre of Gerd Arntz. Unfortunately not in this respect on the pictorial statistics / isotype features.

Please do realise: 'there are no good (design-wise), structured, readable and strict recognizable'  pictorial statistics / isotype symbols / icons present without the specific works in this field by Gerd Arntz. His very specific role at an extremely high level in the development of this field of design is very often underplayed by several institutions internationally. Otto Neurath, nor his later wife Marie Neurath-Reidemeister aren't much of designers of symbols / icons. The early designs of charts by them do fully illustrate my point of view: unreadable matter. I could elaborate extensively on this particular topic.
