I will point out two attributes I found useful: 1) Unlike the Axios display, there are very clear color differences between the levels. The Axios map, using a red gradation, makes it hard to tell between the different levels. 2) Unlike the Axios display, very low percentages are graphed clearly in the green. These shift frequently - green can become red quick in Florida. Being actually in a bunch of hurricanes really made me appreciate that shifting rainbow map.

>	As an infographics designer, I'm often aware that maps have a special "gravity" that often pulls designers away from thinking about what the data actually needs to do. And I'm a bit wary of using maps to display data like storm paths, precisely due to the sorts of problems you describe. So it's always worth at least considering combining or even replacing the map with non-map alternatives.

That happens to be by far and away the most important use case in this context. You do not care about issues of relative geography, coastlines, points of the compass or how far in-land city X or Y is. So why risk confusion by showing that at all? As you say, lives are on the line.
