If I'm interpreting your latest study correctly, you are essentially claiming that if people used angle to determine proportion on a pie chart, they would assign the proportion of the projected angle without compensating for the percept of three-dimensionality, and similarly, if they used arc length, they would assign the proportion of the projected arc length without compensating. That strikes me as unlikely. How have you validated that model?
