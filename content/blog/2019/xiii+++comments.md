>	I agree with everything you said. However, I got really good at YouTube videos, and now I produce them quickly. I'd be happy to team up with you so we can keep our blogs/videos going without too much work. A video is harder than a blog post - hard to keep up all this social media. My goal with my new blog is at least one post per month. I don't think I'll make it, LOL! So feel free to drop me a line if you ever want at dethwench@gmail.com and maybe we can help each other keep up fresh content.
