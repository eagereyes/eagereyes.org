>	The burden of taxation chart is not mislabeled: The “Gross income” label refers to the £ sums at the bottom, not to the green circles. Also, if I read the chart correctly, the tax burden has *increased*, not decreased: blue represents the old level of taxation and red the added tax burden since 1937/38. (I guess this would have been easier to read at the time, when the recent tax increase was probably very well known by most readers.) It can also be seen that taxation has become less progressive, as taxes have risen more in the lower income brackets.

>	Okay, I see your point about the label applying to the numbers and you’re probably also right about which way the tax increased. But it shouldn’t be necessary to be familiar with the data or situation to understand the chart, especially with ISOTYPE! All of this is confusing: what the labels apply to, whether the tax bubbles are stacked or overlap, and what the overall message of the chart even is. So in the world of ISOTYPE charts, this one is still the most confusing and least informative, IMHO.
