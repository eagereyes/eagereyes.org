>	Great post Robert.  It does seem that providing an image is about bringing some kind of meaning to the data.  Ideally you can interpret how it's being framed and have access to the underlying data as well so you can decide if there's more to be discovered.

>	This is a very thought provoking point! I will agree with one caveat: Survey data. I collect a lot of survey data. Survey data is, "Some assembly required". I just recorded a course for LinkedIn Learning that will be called, "Data Curation Foundations". In one chapter, I explain all the survey metadata and curation one has to make when developing surveys so one interprets the data correctly - because there is only ONE interpretation of those data, which is the answers to the survey. Think of how an AI algorithm looks at a new, training set of images. That is how we look at survey data. But for both, there is only really one human interpretation. That's the only caveat I could think of. Good argument!!!

A data file, as in the digital container for your data (xls, csv, json, sqlite), does not denote a primary intent (at the exception of geographic data?). But the data itself can absolutely denote a primary intent, which is generally related to the way the data creator expected the data users to engage with it.
