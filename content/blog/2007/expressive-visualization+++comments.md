>	We tried to coin this phenomenon as &quot;data focus&quot;, ranging from &quot;intrinsic&quot; (highlighting patterns &quot;in&quot; the data) to &quot;extrinsic&quot; (reaching &quot;outside&quot; the data, emphasizing a deeper meaning about &quot;what&quot; the data represents, sometimes even the visualization itself).
