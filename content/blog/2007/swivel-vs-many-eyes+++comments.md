>	<p>This is an excellent review. It looks as though we share much of the same perspective on both of these sites. I would point out, however, that your statement &quot;The interactive features of Many Eyes are wonderful, and would be a major nightmare to code in AJAX or Flash&quot; isn&#39;t entirely accurate. It is certainly more accurate regarding AJAX, although many basic visualizations (treemaps, bubble charts, etc.) can be relatively easy to put together.</p><p>Flash&#39;s capabilities, through Flex, for information visualization are quite impressive and arguably as easy to develop as Java (Flex has some very java-like properties in terms of code construction). For an example take a look at some of the components over at Quietly Scheming (<a href="http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/">http://www.quietlyscheming.com/blog/</a>). Even without outside developer components Flex has offered basic chart functionality from release. I&#39;m surprised neither of these sites has taken advantage of it, particular because of its rich data-binding. One possibility is, of course, the &#39;closed&#39; nature of the platform.</p>

>	I must state that I don't see a downside to choosing Java. Recent versions load fast, even as a browser applets. I've been a Java-hater for quite some time, but with the recent 'opening' of Java I think it might get a second try in the web-app department. I don't know the numbers on Java penetration (maybe someone could visualize it! :) but I'd that it's still in the +85 percentile, good enough for non-critical websites like this one.

>	There are many considerations I believe you have left out, and this leads to an overly fast dismissal of the language. The decision is much more nuanced than calling it a "stumbling block" stemming from Many Eyes' IBM heritage.
>	
>	First, remember to think from the developer's perspective. Most everyone, both academically and professionally, knows Java to some extent. Note how a few researchers banded together and made a product with so many superior characteristics to the fancy startup's version. Java is significantly more mature than AJAX or Flash. Rapid, quality development certainly has its advantages.
>	
>	Second, think about long-term product integration. In what ways can Swivel capitalize on its sunk costs and investment in its codebase? AJAX is mostly bound to the internet, though there are ways to use it locally. Instead, it makes much more business sense to create a solid Java product that could be integrated into any environment, from web to enterprise desktop.
>	
>	Third, the maligning the Java install base makes little sense in comparison to competing technologies. JavaScript has quite a few problems of its own, especially in compatibility across browsers. Yes, all browsers have some amount of it-- but programming to its moving target is a whole can of worms in itself (see #1). Thus, its installed base cannot be considered as pervasive as first glance would imply. Flash is even worse; my experience gives it very low performance and many technical difficulties, making it still much more of a niche product. AJAX is not the Internet's silver bullet.
>	
>	I believe the fundamental fallacy here is lack of context. Swivel wants to be on the Internet exclusively; IBM would prefer not to have Many Eyes tied down to any one medium or take too much effort to flesh out quickly. They want maximum returns on research investment, making Java a no-brainer. It is only from our personal, limited perspective that the technology appears sub-optimal.

>	That said, I complement you on an excellently written article.

>	<p>I love Java. There is no other language that is truly cross-platform, or which gives you so much convenience (standard class library, error checking, etc.), and still good performance. But I am concerned about the future of the language, because Microsoft is working actively against it, and Sun just won&#39;t have the power to push it forever.</p><p>I have been using Google Analytics for a few days now, and that tells me that over 97% of my visitors have Java enabled. That&#39;s a good sign. But I also have a much higher percentage of Mac and Linux users than average, and so that may look quite different on other websites. But it gives me hope. </p>

>	I agree with Matthew, also because ActionScript technology is becoming also opened and more powerfull than ever.
>	New service and products opportuniting are also arising; among others I think Apollo and Papervision3d could increase the usage of ActionScript/Flash platform for web based infovis solutions.

>	Hello Professor Kosara, 
>	I have extensively used both services and I agree with most of your remarks. 
>	Here at the OECD like many "progressive" official statistics providers, we rethinking the way we disseminate data. So my focus is rather on "publishing data" than on "visualizing data". 
>	In that aspect I am a bit disappointed by both offerings. In house, we store a great amount of metadata on any of our products or statistical objects and we're still far from perfection. But here, we can only fill a very limited number of fields, sometimes with strong constraints (i.e. no formatting in many eyes descriptive texts! not even line/paragraph breaks!). As a result I find that as a user (rather than as a data producer) navigating among the datasets requires considerable effort. 
>	I've published a few hundreds datasets on both sites, and unsurprisingly a couple receive all the traffic while the others get none. that's simply because the successful datasets were on the top of a list at some point while the unseen datasets would have required the user to page down through results. once you have a rough idea of what you are looking for, it is not possible to drill down to it step by step, you must search for it exactly or never find it. (or maybe it is possible but then it is implemented in such a way that users don't do it). I see this as a big obstacle. 
>	about the variety of visualization types available, what I've seen from IBM suggests that many eyes could implement many more, while swivel stick to a few basic ones. is that a bad thing, I think not, it is already so easy for a novice user to use the wrong chart type and produce meaningless results that still look relevant at first glance...
>	regarding technical choices, I also very much question the use of java. No, anonymous, java is not lightning-fast on all current computers, it is annoyingly slow on quite a few. I do second Matthew's comment about flex, which seems to be the obvious evolution!

>	A very interesting read indeed. Its great to see so many folks thinking about this. Here is my perspective on <a href="http://inquisant.com/?p=4">what's wrong with Swivel</a>.
>	</p>
>	<p>
>	To allow wider participation, adoption and prorogation a spirit of openness would be required. Standards can work wonders. If only one of these players would put a stake in the ground and create a standard for data and its visualization. The standard could minimally define an XML Schema for storing numerical data, a common set of APIs for storage, retrieval and update of data along with a standard approach which allows third party developers to build visualizations which can be plugged into any of these sites.

>	Hi Robert,
>	Great review.  I'm doing something similar over at StatSheet.com targeted at sports stats.  One big difference is instead of needing to bring your own data to create graphs, users of the <a href="http://statsheet.com/chart_builder">StatSheet Chart Builder</a> can use the StatSheet database.  Right now I've limited it to a subset of my college basketball data (back to 1996), but over time I plan on opening it up to other sports.  <a href="http://statsheet.com/chart_list">Check it out</a>.  I'd appreciate any feedback!
