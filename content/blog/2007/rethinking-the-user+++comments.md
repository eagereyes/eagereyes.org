If they did, they wouldn't make many of the mistakes that I've seen in designing the tools. Also, I believe that grouping everyone who does not develop visualization tools (which includes me) creates too broad a category and one that cannot be described with the term "casual users." People can be exceptionally expert in the use of visualization tools without ever being involved in developing one. I propose that the user category be divided into multiple levels of expertise.

A notable example is software to build 3D animations like <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=7635018">Maya</a>. Is it any easier to use than a typical infovis tool? I don't think so.

Most of the people use software tools for specific purposes, with quite clear desired outcomes (e.g., I use PhotoShop because I want to polish up this photo I love). Are we able to support desired outcomes with visualizations?

>	I fully agree on your comment. In think a visualisation is good if the user does not need to think about it but can use it to "get the work done(tm)":) However, the design of such a visualisation becomes very complicated if the tool is very general. Maybe there is a relationship between general visualisations (such as trees) and more specific visualisations...

I think you might be interested ;-)

>	<p>You say, "The current view of course is that visualization systems should be designed in a way that is useful to domain experts with little to no knowledge of visualization. In reality, of course these are not the actual users of visualizations: rather, the tools are run by their developers, in communication with the domain experts."</p>

>	<p>I've no real experience with information visualization, and I was wondering how this meshes with <a href="../../blog/2009/a-better-vis-web-community.html">your recent post</a> about the desire for substance in the infoviz community.  In particular, I didn't realize there already was a community around pairing infoviz experts with domain experts.  Is this within the context of consulting?  I came by these posts while searching for examples of how infoviz experts work _with_ domain experts, thinking that there were few.  I'd be especially interested to hear about examples of domain experts and infoviz experts meeting halfway, where each gets familiar with the others' skillset (maybe by diving into molecular biology/playing with Processing) to mutual benefit.</p>
