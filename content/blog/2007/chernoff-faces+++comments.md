>	An interesting study (Michael D. Lee and Rachel E. Reilly, 2003, &quot;An Empirical Evaluation of Chernoff Faces, Star Glyphs, and Spatial Visualizations for Binary Data&quot;), &quot;found that both glyph visualizations lead to slow, inaccurate answers being given with low confidence&quot;.
>   I think Chernoff faces are the pie charts of multidimensional visualization. One of the problems with both designs is the familiar metaphor. We shouldn&#39;t try too hard to translate abstract data into some identifiable images. Not only there are cognitive/perceptual issues to be solve but also you can&#39;t just remove your social stereotypes from the analysis of something as powerful as a face.

>	Hey, I like pie charts! They have a lot of advantages, unlike chernoff faces. So far I have seen no scientific studies that point out problems with pie charts.

>	I'd like to second the note from the previous "anonymous" on pie charts: can any reader point to specific citations of studies on pie charts? Note that an experiment showing that, say, people have a harder time comparing angles than lengths is <strong>not</strong> the same as a study on pie charts. Neither is an essay in which someone guesses that pie charts are bad because people are not great at judging angles or areas.
>	My intuition is the overall effect of a pie chart comes from a lot of interacting factors and in fact pies can be pretty effective.

>	I don&#39;t know of study that would adress exactly that. There is good circumstantial evidence from tons of studies on basic perception, though. There may also be some material on this in Colin Ware's book. Looks like a good idea for a bunch of user studies, though ...

>	I understand your point, but I think you can't break the link between a chart and its "perceptual mechanics". Because there is no pie. There are thousands of them and you would have to have a good sample to get some basic conclusions. And of course you would have to cross that with familiarity, previous knowledge and experience, etc. Too much work.

>	The root of all prejudice against pie chars seems to be in the studies by Croxton in 1927 and 1932. You may want to take a look at <a href="http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/~spence/Spence%202005.pdf">this paper</a> for a balanced account. The author says "In my opinion, much of the adverse criticism of the pie has come from those who have wished it to do more than it could. The pie chart is a simple information graphic whose principal purpose is to show the relationship of a part to the whole. It is, by and large, the wrong choice as an exploratory device, and it is certainly not the correct choice when the graph maker or graph reader has a complicated purpose in mind, such as displaying small changes in proportion over time". I couldn't agree more.

Perhaps you could take a look at <a href="http://bizviz.jorgecamoes.com/mil-dados-mil-graficos-parte-2/">the one with pie charts</a>. It is useless (because I am asking too much). Even "star glyphs", that are similar to Chernoff faces, perform better.

>	If face perception is like language perception--another kind subject to pareidolia--then what we'd expect I think is a special sensitivity to what we call "facial expressions," or to those by which we "read" and communicate our mental and emotional states. "Disgust," for example. We develop our ability to discriminate the vowels of our native language as children and can't hear the distinctions in languages we try to learn as adult--for example Swedish, which has many more vowel sounds than English does (see Patricia Kuhl's work). The distinctions that we've learned to make effectively deafen us to new ones. If you used a continuous scale of vowel sounds to signify temperature or wind speed--in the same way that you might use the distance between the two eyes in a Chernoff cartoon--then the people you subjected to this data representation would get a very gappy and skewed perception of it. A gradual increase in temperature over time might look more like a hop and skip through several. Color theory might provide a better analogy (we perceive any given wavelength of light as a weighted sum of three colors, if I'm remembering right). It might be possible to develop a "face scale" to represent things other than mood and mental state and to do so with a flat or linear sensitivity--to the extent that our expressions convey how disgusted we are and not just whether or not we are disgusted. But I think the starting point for creating such a scale would have to be the faces of real people and really experiencing disgust to varying degrees. (Would you really want to represent annual burger sales with an animated face expressing varying disgust?) Representing data across several dimensions with facial expressions--using a degree of disgust plus a degree of anger, for example--strikes me as even more problematic . Maybe disgust and anger add together simply, but other real expressions must be mutually exclusive (joy + fear?) Also I wouldn't be surprised if many naturally occuring combinations carried learned significances, and so our perception of a continuum of combinations of the same two things in varying amounts would be gappy and skewed and maybe also compete with the meanings of the two things seperately.

>	Would love to follow up on this reply when I get some time here. I took a topics course on Facial Perception last year, and had actually been thinking about the issue a little at the time. I ended up giving a presentation on Robin Thomas' 2001 paper "Characterizing Perceptual Interactions in Face Identification Using Multidimensional Signal Detection Theory"  as part of the course, and I could see how it could suggest problems for Chernoff faces. The paper was somewhat hard to find if I remember correctly, so I'll have to update with the volume it was published in when I get home.

>	The study made use of schematic faces, that held facial contour constant. The setup varied eye separation, nose length, and mouth width with each of 3 subjects receiving 4 possible configurations to distinguish between. Responses were collected in observation-confusion matrices?(I'll have to check, might be identification-confusion?). In any case, they found perceptual dependency between eye separation and nose length. As well as between nose length and mouth width. One of the interpretations given was that the perceptual system maintains area over a triangle of bordering features (if the nose is perceived as longer then the eye separation will perceived as wider).
