>	My husband's grandfather, Dwight Barr, was the person who created this chart.  There is a wonderful article in Physics Central about the making of the chart:  http://physicsbuzz.physicscentral.com/2013/09/making-chart-of-electromagnetic.html
>	My father-in-law and his siblings can vividly remember all the parts of the chart laid out on the living room floor of their home while Dwight worked on it. We have audio tapes of Grandpa Barr talking about making the chart.
