>	On a tangent to this, the issue of tasks and users is something I've also wondered about in the context of why it is that infoviz isn't much used by "hard core" data analysts. At least, my observation of the work of those whose job it is to provide themselves and others with actionable answers to questions of data shows they don't use anything much more visual than the occasional line chart or scatter plot.

>	I think the interesting contrast with algorithms is that you only say algorithms are optimal *with respect to a model*. The traditional "impossible algorithm" is radix sort: it runs faster than O(n log n) because it doesn't actually follow the comparison model.

The last serious attempt was probably Pinker's theory of graph comprehension (which I unfortunately don't see how to use as a model for comparing different visualizations or really designing new ones).

>	I reduced the problem to two numbers: what's the perfect visualization for such small dataset? My argument is that context, goals and interpretation are so important it's impossible to find a 'perfect' or 'the best' possible visualization.

>	For me, there is another factor to consider : the enjoyment of the user. It participates to captivating its interest, ensure its maintained attention, and contributes to its reuse of the graphical presentation. A "perfect" visualization should also be enjoyable, beautiful, aesthetic, for its user.
