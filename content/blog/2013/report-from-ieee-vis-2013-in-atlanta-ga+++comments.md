>	Hi Robert:
>	
>	Just wanted to clarify and enhance some comments you made under the "Academic Market" section of your report on being a senior member of the visualization community.  
>	
>	IEEE Vis 2013 also included a meeting of the Visualization Pioneers Group (VPG) on Monday evening.  To join the VPG, one must have contributed to the field of visualization for over 20 years.  20 years of contribution to visualization does not mean "retirement" age. More information about the VPG can be found at:
>	(http://ieeevis.org/year/2013/info/overview-amp-topics/visualization-pioneers-group-vpg)
>	
>	As for your retirement from academia, some of the discussion you over heard, perhaps after the Keynote session on Tuesday at Vis 2013, may have resulted from remarks that Professor Emeritus Gregory M. Nielson made upon receiving the 2013 Visualization Career Award from the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics (IEEE VGTC).  Greg received his award at the start of the Keynote session. Dr. Nielson's contributions to visualization include his seminal research in geometry/topology-based modeling algorithms for visualization, cofounding the Visualization Conference and cofounding  IEEE Computer Society’s IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) journal. In his remarks, Greg asked how many people had attended the first IEEE Visualization Conference in 1990.  He then reflected on how the field of Visualization had matured since the founding of the IEEE Visualization Conference.  Greg also noted that at this time in his life, he felt he was in a terrific position as an emeritus professor. Given a well earned pension, he could be selective about the visualization research, teaching and mentoring he wanted to conduct. It sure was a terrific advertisement for becoming emeritus as well as continuing to enjoy contributing to the field of visualization.  No doubt, many senior members of the Visualization community might consider joining Greg with the type of endorsement.  These people do not see themselves as out to pasture at all but as starting a new phase in their lives, perhaps continuing to contribute to visualization, with a fresh sense of wonder.

>	Your Blog entry represents this event very incorrectly:  "In the opening session, somebody asked who had been at the first Vis conference in 1990. Only a few hands went up. I wasn’t able to count, but I would guess fewer than 10. After some thought, I think that’s a good thing. It means that the field is able to evolve because new people can participate. If the same people stick around forever, nothing is going to change." -- Robert Kosara
>	
>	That somebody you refer to is indeed Greg Nielson. Without his and others contributions in 1990, you and many others would not have an IEEE Vis event to report about.  As Greg's contributions would now be called in the SciVis domain and you have made contributions to the Info Vis and Visual Analytics domain, my guess is the Greg is just "somebody" to you.  I assure you that Dr. Nielson is a far more significant contributor to visualization than your remarks note and that you stand on his shoulders although you might not be aware of it.
>	
>	Additionally, as one of the small number of people who held up their hand when Dr. Nielson asked who had attended the first IEEE Visualization Conference in 1990, let me also note that people do not stay static in their thinking. Over time, people mature, change and evolve as teachers, researchers, investigators, and administrators. People do not just  "stick around forever" with no changes.  You yourself have done so. You moved from goals and horizons as a academic professor to now being an active contributor to Tableau.
>	
>	Dr Nielson's remarks indicated that there is a bright future in actively contributing to visualization as an Emeritus Professor.  He is continuing to show how to handle "uncharted territory" in our field of visualization. It really is terrific that he received the 2013 Visualization Career Award.

>	Theresa-Marie,

>	I was not talking about Greg Nielson or the vis pioneers when I was talking about people retiring. I just threw those things together because they both show the immense change in the field. I've seen fields where the same people have been running the main conference for 40 years, and believe me, you don't want that. I'm well aware of Greg Nielson's and many others' contributions to the field (I know my way around SciVis!), and Greg's role in starting the conference in the first place!

>	The retirement stories are all second-hand, so I don't want to talk about names. But they come from people I trust, so I don't have a doubt that they are true.

" -&gt; without making an effort to set this record straight.  That someone was the IEEE 2013 Visualization Career Award Recipient who also co-founded the IEEE Visualization Conference. He is definitely a well regarded "someone" in visualization.

>	A comment on the section on evaluation. Actually - there are many different evaluation goals and, thus, types of evaluation. User performance evaluation is what people seem to mean most of the time when they say "evaluation" - but there are many other types. We presented a study this year (in SciVis so you may have missed it) where we showed that in SciVis 98% of papers included at least one type of evaluation (sometimes more than one) and we also looked at InfoVis 2012 and 2011 and found that 94% of papers in that year contained an evaluation in the broader sense [1,2]. So what that says it that there are many more ways to convince a reader that your technique is good than with user performance metrics and almost every paper does some evaluation (most of the ones without evaluation were theoretical papers like Sedlmair et al.'s Design Study Methodology paper). One of the things I most agreed with on that panel was Tamara's comment that when a reviewer asks for a user performance evaluation - it typically means that your technique isn't already convincing, you have not provided good alternative forms of evaluation - and not that the reviewer is following some unofficial rule of asking for an eval to be added that would be unnecessary. What bugged me in the panel is that it was suggested that it is in fact very common that reviewers ask for these evaluations to be added - and at least from my experience over the years serving on the PC I cannot confirm this to be true. I have only seen it once where the evaluation in the paper was so poorly done that it had to be removed or redone and both were deemed acceptable (it was redone properly).

>	Hi Robert:
>	I am writing to add my two cents regarding your comments on our work, StoryFlow. 
>	
>	1.	“This isn’t even the first paper on this topic, but one that improves some aspects of earlier automated layout tools and makes them more efficient.” 
>	We believe our work is significantly different from previous work. The major contribution of our work is an efficient hybrid optimization strategy. The novelty of the strategy is two-fold. First, the optimization strategy splits the optimization into separate sub-problems and optimizes the important metrics first. Second, we judiciously combines discrete and continuous optimization to generate an aesthetically pleasing and legible storyline visualization efficiently. The discrete optimization aims to minimize the number of line crossings and wiggles, while the continuous optimization focuses on minimizing the wiggle distance and white space. Compared with the state-of-the-art method (Tanahashi and Ma), it supports real-time user interactions, hierarchical relationships among entities, and rendering of a large number of entity lines. Our method can generate a storyline with hundreds of entities and hundreds of time frames in less than 1 second. The state-of-the-art method (Tanahashi and Ma) often takes hours to generate such a storyline.

>	2.	“As much as I enjoy xkcd, this is very much a toy problem (and also a bit like a very long explanation for a joke) .The technique is neat, but it’s also extremely limited in its scope and possible applications.”
>	This is not a toy problem. Although the storyline visualization was originally invented by XKCD for showing the interactions among characters, it has been proved to be useful for many applications where dynamic graphs are involved. For example, it can track community evolution in dynamic social networks and trace generational relationships in genealogical data. Actually, after my talk, I was approached immediately by two audience (one from academia and one from a big company) who were very interested in our techniques and wanted to try our technique to visualize their biological data and business data, respectively. Here I list some work that use the storyline visualization for data exploration and analysis:
>	•	Sequence Bundles. http://science-practice.com/projects/sequence-bundles/
>	•	N. W. Kim, S. K. Card, and J. Heer. Tracing genealogical data with timenets. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces, pages 241–248, 2010.
>	•	K. Reda, C. Tantipathananandh, A. Johnson, J. Leigh, and T. Berger-Wolf. Visualizing the evolution of community structures in dynamic social networks. Comp. Graphics Forum, 30(3):1061–1070, 2011.
>	
>	In our work, in addition to a few basic experiments for comparison, we also presented an interesting case study of using StoryFlow to explore large-scale Twitter data (with 90 million tweets and 900 opinion leaders) about the 2012 US presidential election (see the case study in our project page: **********http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/ycwu/projects/infovis13.html **********). The study was conducted with two sociologists (one is from City University of Hong Kong, and the other is from Nanyang Technological University) in media and communication studies to demonstrate the usefulness of our technique. Specifically, we used StoryFlow to help the domain experts visually trace the evolution of the temporal relationships between opinion leaders based on their attention to different topics on social media. We have also reported the interesting insights that we have discovered using StoryFlow visualization in Section 7.2 of the paper. 
>	
>	We have also conducted a semi-structured interview with three domain experts, one film professor in Tsinghua University in China, and two sociologists in media and communication studies from City University of Hong Kong and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. They provided very positive and encouraging feedback on the utility and usefulness of the technique. The feedback is summarized in Section 7.3. One of the sociologists said “StoryFlow would be particularly useful for data-driven journalism because it not only provides a clear visual summary of events but also shows informative context for investigative analysis”. The other sociologist also very liked our work and he commented “It is stunning and engaging. It definitely outperforms the static infographics that I have seen before”. The film professor suggested a variety of interesting use scenarios in the film industry: Film directors can use StoryFlow to understand the story evolution in a movie to make a proper plan for the film shooting; Script adapters can use Storyflow to review a script quickly to decide whether to add or remove certain characters or scenes; Actors can use StoryFlow to better trace their related scenes and see immediately where and who they will interact with, so that they can better prepare for their performance.

>	3.	“Do we really want to spend resources on refining this further? There are much bigger fish to fry.”
>	I respectfully disagree with you. As I pointed out early, storyline visualization is useful and has many applications. Our work is a big step forward in this research direction.
>	I believe research on visualization technologies that are useful, visible, and highly appreciated by people from other fields such as graph visualization is also “bigger fishes”. Without the core technologies, it would be hard for other people to identify the field and distinguish the field. I believe storyline visualization is one of the visualization techniques we should further study.
