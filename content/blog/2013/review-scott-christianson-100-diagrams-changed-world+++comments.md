>	Thanks for mentioning this book.  As someone who studies color theory and its impact on visualization, I was really inspired to see that a 1766 color wheel by Mose Harris was included in the 100 Diagrams: http://pinterest.com/pin/85709199130224993/.
>	
>	In the color wheel diagram, Mose Harris depicted how colors are created out of Red, Blue and Yellow (the RYB Color Model).  He also shows how combining the RYB colors together produces black in the diagram.  One of the earliest depictions of subtractive color models.
>	
>	Mose Harris works was a follow on to the Newton's earlier 1704 Circle of Colors diagram published by Newton in his Optiks book.  Newton defined the first color wheel by connecting the violet end fo the color spectrum to the red start point.  Newton was working in what we call today Red, Green, Blue (RGB) color space - additive colors while Mose Harris worked in subtractive (RYB) color space.

>	It is interesting how Christianson notes the importance of Mose Harris' diagram in helping to define subtractive color theory that would go on to be extensively studied and applied by artists for centuries.
>	
>	Today, was we move toward using RGB color space on display devices, including our smart phones, we are sometimes challenged to understand the differences between RGB and RYB color spaces. This is especially true when we use a color app for our smart phone from paint companies like Sherwin Williams and Benjamin Moore to find the color we like for  painting a room in our home. When we go to the paint store, sometime the color we liked in RGB (Newton) color space via our smart phone does not match the actual paint color based on RYB (Mose Harris) color space available in a paint can.  So, the Mose Harris diagram continues to challenge and change the world.
