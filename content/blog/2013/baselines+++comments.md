>	BTW: I understand the point, but to me it seems a bit of a bold assumption that people aren't able to read bar-charts and graphs. If however this is the case, and you still want to point out differences in more detail, a caption pointing out the non-0 baseline could possibly serve just as well?

>	It's not that folks can't effectively read a bar chart, but that in less than a second our preattentive processing has already digested the "skewed" data and it requires deliberate further investigation to separate out that initial preattentive bias from what's actually going on. Given how quickly most people scan through things, that preattentive glance may be all that occurs and will leave them with a skewed perception. Even if folks take time to pour over the non-0-baselined version, that initial bias has a lingering, powerful after-effect on the take-away message.

>	Imagine a different chart above where the values are in billions, but with variances between each only being a few dollars, but with the baseline being $29billion and each tick being a dollar. It's unlikely a dollar difference here or there would mean anything at all, but the chart would look exactly like the skewed one above and give a completely wrong first impression. Sadly, many shops use this technique to deliberately lie with or at least strongly misrepresent what the underlying data is actually saying. Baseline == 0 combined with a difference chart lets the data tell the story honestly.

Because of the shared context of the "step" of change (standard deviation), the second part is free to be rescaled to focus on the change aspect of the data.

>	The problem is that the visualization contradicts the data. The data says "very little variation" and the bars say "very big variation". Yes, you can then read the scale and cancel the visual, but it defeats the purpose of the visual.

>	I agree. Line graphs seem to be getting a pass, for reasons I fail to understand. To me, they are just as misleading as bar graphs with a baseline that does not start a zero. Your example shows this well.

>	I think you guys are overstating the case for a zero baseline for line charts. The precognitive effects described by hrbrmstr above that cause such misinterpretation of truncated bar charts are not nearly as pronounced in line charts. And I think the example shows that it's not such a problem as with bar charts.
