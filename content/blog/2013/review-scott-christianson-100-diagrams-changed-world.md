# Review: Scott Christianson, 100 Diagrams That Changed the World

I recently came across this book that claims to collect the 100 most important diagrams in the history of mankind. It’s a good collection, with many wonderful examples, though it has its flaws.

To get the main issue out of the way: the title is misleading. The selection in the book is not based on the quality of the diagrams, but rather of the invention or cultural shift they are associated with. I didn’t bother to count, but there are many examples of diagrams in the book that, by themselves, are really not interesting, but which are attached to important: the mobile phone, Apple computers, cotton gin, and the camera obscura, to name just a few.

Having said that, however, there is still a lot of value in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452298776">Scott Christianson's <em>100 Diagrams That Changed the World: From the Earliest Cave Paintings to the Innovation of the iPod</em></a>. There are many interesting examples of diagrams where the actual diagrams are the innovation, or where the innovation would not have happened with the diagram: the flow chart, the periodic table, line and bar charts, ancient "sheet music" (carved into a clay tablet), the Pioneer plaque, etc.

This is a great book to flip through and pick up pieces here and there. The descriptions go into as much depth as they can on a single page, and give a lot of interesting historical information. The print and reproduction of images is mostly excellent, with a few images being of slightly lower quality.

It's easy to argue about inclusions (the Intel 4004 processor?) and omissions (how could he leave out ISOTYPE?), but overall this is a great collection. It works well as a coffee table book and for browsing, as well as to appreciate the fine detail and resolution of many of the pieces. Yes, this book is only available as a hardcover, and that’s a good thing.
