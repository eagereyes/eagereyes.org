>	Hi Robert:
>	
>	This a really good summary of the current perceptions on publishing in the visualization field.  As you note, there are some situations in the "What about..." category that can be just as distinguished as a pure academic publication in the visualization community.  
>	
>	For example, being a winner in the "International Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge" sponsored by NSF and Science Magazine carries an esteem level of visualization quality that is a little different from publishing a paper: http://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/scivis/
>	
>	Landing the front cover of a magazine such as Science or the having one's scientific animation featured in a PBS  special or network news broadcast also carries with it a high level of recognition in the scientific visualization field. 
>	
>	Being a successful entry into the Electronic Theater at the annual SIGGRAPH Conference, due to the highly competitive nature of the jury submissions, is also a high level (top tier) accomplishment.
>	
>	These would be different from paper publication.
>	
>	Thanks for providing the really good summary of ranking of visualization publication venues.

>	Thanks a lot, especially for not taking for granted that your readers knew all the basics. I learned a lot. Now I hope someone will write a similar post for non-academic conference !

>	Thanks for the post. I just wanted to point out that for some venues, the bar for short papers is as high as for full papers. For CHI and UIST, the acceptance rate for short papers is even lower.

>	Hi,

>	The report seems accurate to me. You may want to cite Google Scholar that classifies Visualization as a subfield of computer graphics: http://scholar.google.fr/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_computergraphics
>	
>	You can also take a look at Human-Computer Interaction since Visualization is strong there: http://scholar.google.fr/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_humancomputerinteraction
>	
>	The only notable difference with your ranking there is that PacificVis is visible while IVS is not.
>	This is based on h5-index, the H-index from the last 5 years. The difference in perception might come from your old-time presence in the field Robert!

>	In addition it would be good to note journals in different fields that individuals can either publish their work in (or at least should peruse on occasion for related research). They of course may be less noteworthy for someone interested in padding a vitae for specifically comp. sci., but hopefully that isn't a big hindrance.

>	Statistics specifically has the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (more aimed at theoretical statistics) or the Journal of Statistical Software (if of course you published software) are two that come to mind.
>	
>	It stands to be said that if your visualization is aimed at a particular field of interest the paper will be more easily on topic in any field specific journal. For example if the paper is related to visualizing geographic data there are a ton of different potential journals it might be find a good home at (Cartographia, Journal of Cartography &amp; GIS, The Cartographic Journal to name only a few). (Unfortunately other fields besides geography don't tend to be as welcoming to viz. papers.)

>	Robert, I doubt we can have a fair discussion of conference venues w/out accounting for the time factor and VIS splits. By the logic above, VAST was in its starter years a mid-tier conference to InfoVis's first tier; InfoVis was in its starter years a mid-tier conference to SciVis's first tier; SciVis/Vis was in its starter years a mid-tier conference to SIGGRAPH's first tier. And graphics and visualization used to be the left-handed stepchild of Computer Science. Yet, weren't our founders at SIGGRAPH, Vis/SciVis, InfoVis, VAST, BioVis, LDAV etc. exactly in those starter years, and weren't all these exciting venues? Not to mention BioVis streamlines publication to a 2.75 impact factor venue compared to InfoVis's 2.11.
>	
>	PS: I'll agree with the short papers/posters comments above. SciVis/Vis featured at least one year when the poster acceptance rate was lower than the one for regular papers; and the SIGGRAPH posters run, and get awards, in the ACM Student Research Competition.

Liz Marai says…
>	... compared to InfoVis's 2.21, not 2.11, sorry, my bad. Anyway, why are we splitting hairs? We're blessed with higher impact factors than most CS venues.

>	UIST is considered by HCI researchers as first tier venue for system-based HCI research despite its symposium status.  I do agree that there are not that many vis work published there, but some years good visualization system papers get published there too.
