>	I think putting this together would be a real benefit, but also a real challenge.  Practically speaking, perhaps the most likely to work approach would be an industry-academic partnership.  Perhaps you could cast a somewhat wider net and include not just data visualization, but all visualization (cartography/mapping, scientific, etc.).  See if you could find a set of sponsoring organizations, enough so the organization cost of sponsorship is relatively low, then try to get one or more universities involved as the source of labor.  You would, I would think, want to target universities with good sized, and well-respected, visualization-related programs, especially graduate programs (as I figure grad students will probably be providing a lion's share of the leg work ;-).  They would need to have faculty members willing and able to participate in some of the comparative and selective work.  Consider only peer-reviewed work, or have two categories, clearly separated, between peer-reviewed and non-peer work.

That said, these kinds of groups are put together for many purposes, so it could be done.  Whether you could get any industry buy-in absent some kind of economc benefit (e.g., competitive advantage to membership, disadvantage to lack of membership, reduced costs because a third party is now providing a service that used to be done by in-house personnel, etc.) is uncertain.

I could see an academic outlet that has strength in both visualization and journalism collaborating to build an outlet using student labor (overseen by editors) to go the non-profit route. Or there are other models out there that seem to be successful for translating research into blog posts: http://crowdresearch.org/blog/

>	Good point, Robert. The visualization research should be more accessible people outside the scientific community.

>	In addition to the points you mentioned, I can think of the following two points:

>	1. Encouraging more surveys and STARs (State-of-the-Art Reports).
>	They give a comprehensive overview of an interesting topic in visualization, the challenges associated with it, and guidelines on using available techniques or results for this topic.

>	Some recent STARs on information visualization topics:

>	Glyph-based Visualization: Foundations, Design Guidelines, Techniques and Applications (2013)

>	Until now, Eurographics was the only conference offering a STAR track (and was more focused on Computer Graphics than on Visualization).
>	Finally, EuroVis 2014 introduced a dedicated track for STARs

>	2. Encouraging the collaborative building of taxonomies
>	
>	I think taxonomies make it somehow easier for people to pick up papers and techniques about the problem they are trying to solve.
>	
>	here is an ambitious initative by Oxford for that: http://www.ovii.org/community/taxonomy/
>	They have even a dedicated category for existing taxonomies http://www.ovii.org/community/taxonomy/132/
>	But it is still in the beginning and needs engaging many people from the community to add their papers.
>	
>	There are also dedicated taxonomies on a specific topic:
>	Hans-Jörg Schulz is running a website with nice and navigable collection of techniques for visualizing hierarchical data http://www.treevis.net/
>	Christian Tominski and Wolfgang Aigner are running a similar collection of techniques for time-oriented data
