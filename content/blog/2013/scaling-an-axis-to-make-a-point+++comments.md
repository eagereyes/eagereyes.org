I can't understand how Reuters chose the order of the data. Putting CEOs at the end seems unhelpful given that Boards of directors are above CEOs. Also, this is a hierarchy and seems better represented in a vertical format, with the top job being on top. To me, the data suggests that it's still more common to include women as an agent of diversity, since Boards have several members, than to be truly neutral and recruit an equal number of men and women. The vertical redesign made me see this.

>	Why do we need 50% female and 50% male? Why can't it be 80% female and 20% male. Or vise versa. In my opinion we do not need an equal amount of Female to male CEO's, but CEO's that are good and fit the requirements.
