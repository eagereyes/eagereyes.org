>	"Graph visualization sucks".  No argument about that being true for traditional techniques and current common practice.  But I contend that by taking the approach, demonstrated by BioFabric, that nodes can be successfully represented as higher-dimensional geometric primitives (i.e. lines) instead of as points in a node-link diagram, there is now a new way to think about and experiment with graph visualization.  In other words, maybe "In 2013, maybe graph visualization doesn't have to suck as bad anymore"?

>	One of the interesting things in newspapers graphics is how interdisciplinary the teams are.  We hear that from Amanda Cox and Kevin Quealy every time they speak or post about the NYT process.  Academic work -- and we see this in the papers -- is NOT interdisciplinary in the same sense.  And it really shows in the output, which will usually be strong on one dimension but really bad on the others.  The other issue with academic research is that the tendency towards building frameworks and systems, at least for vis tools, rather dilutes perceived value from the outside.  Until someone creates something amazing with it - like the NYT with Mike's help.

>	It is exciting to see infovis technology move into the mainstream. Storytelling of course is fascinating and is often essential to communicate with any audience. However I have some qualms. Some folks spent many years learning to read and write academic papers, read and write code, understand and occasionally invent algorithms, use some discrete math, and even build usable large scale systems. Some people spent years studying and learning to create graphic designs or even art, or learning to write or tell stories. They are both necessary skills but it is a fact of life that what the math/code nerds do and what the art/journalism kids do are very different, they are usually not good at doing what the other group does, and the pay scales are very different.

>	As for the criticism that graph visualization, er, is lacking, but BioVis is great. Sure, in the end, domain-specific representations and tools are really what you want. But how do you get there?  BioVis is built on more fundamental techniques. The best, most beautiful systems are going to have sophisticated underlying algorithms that generate beautiful representations automatically, because not many of us can get 20 designers from the NYT to design special purpose HTML5 graphics for one particular data set. It doesn't scale. Interaction doesn't make up for lousy visualization algorithms - "I'm sorry it looks bad, but maybe you can use these controls to get something better." More basic, domain-independent techniques will also be in demand there's the question of what to do when a data set doesn't fit some canned domain-specific tool. Some people that have worked in network visualization for a long time do realize that the audience doesn't want to draw networks - they want to create diagrams, but the technology is really lagging. If anything there should be more investment in this area, not less.

The thing about successful news graphics isn't just their aesthetics, but also the thought processes that go into them and the fact that they simply work extremely well. That is way beyond prettiness, it's about understanding the purpose of what is to be shown.
