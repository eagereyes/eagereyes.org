>	Not only have you mis-represented Tufte as anti-aesthetic (he's a patron of the arts for heaven's sake, and has his own gallery in New York!), you have mis-understood the idea of chart junk. You say "Instead of minimization at all cost, we are now asking questions about the purpose of this thing you are creating." But removing chart junk is done AFTER his first rule "Above all, show the data." If the visual device you have chosen does not show the data, together with necessary context or highlighting then the data/ink ratio is irrelevant, and this post is similarly irrelevant to it.

>	I agree wholeheartedly with Robert here. And what does "above all, show the data" really mean? If I write down a table with very small numbers and leave the rest of the page white, I am showing all the data, and am minimizing chart junk. Or am I?

>	The whole point is that Tufte's principles seem to require Tufte's (admitted fantastic, perhaps unparalleled) aesthetic sense. But then, why not make the principle "you shall only let Tufte-like minds draw charts" instead? It would amount to the same outcome: Tufte can draw awesome data graphics, and few, if anyone else can follow his principles correctly.

Jonathan says…
>	If you write down a table with very small numbers and leave the rest of the page white, then that's not a statistical graphic. Sure, there might be a context in which doing that is better than a chart of some kind, but your argument is otherwise a straw man.

Jonathan says…
>	Robert, you're not going to find a principle of aesthetic that works better than a guideline like the data/ink ratio, or indeed any other design principle for that matter. It's fine to rail against the mis-use of, say, symmetry or density, but to suggest that those principles themselves are flawed is another matter entirely. And in any case, what is arbitrary about the data/ink ratio?

carlosscheidegger says…
>	You're missing the point. It's not about "lists vs charts." I hate numeric tables with a passion. But I believe Robert is trying to distill an actual principle. Currently is no good, *general* principle of visualization that can consistently be acted upon. That's the "definition" I think that Robert is going after. Everything else we have are just rules of thumb. That's good for (some) practice, but not good for thoroughly understanding visualizations.

>	Incidentally, there's no good definition of statistical graphic, either! "plots 'x, y, z, and w' are statistical graphics" doesn't count (yes, I have read Bertin, Wilkinson, Wickham, Stolte, MacKinlay, etc. It's not there, at least not in any way that fundamentally forbids a numeric table from being interpreted as a graphic.)

>	I did not say that the data/ink ratio was arbitrary, but that people claim to be maximizing it when they're really doing something else (i.e., following some arbitrary rule or making ad-hoc decisions). There is nothing wrong with doing that, but I hate the pretense that we're following a principle here, and that the principle, when followed, leads to good charts.
>	
>	Carlos gets it: my point is that we need to figure out a principle or rule that we can actually follow and that, when followed, leads us to a meaningful goal. I think that the one I've stated above does that, while Tufte's definition of chart junk and data-ink does not.

>	The trouble with your principle ("Chart junk is any element of a chart that does not contribute to clarifying the intended message") is that it's completely subjective. The point of the data/ink ratio is that it's a principle that can be tested objectively. If I think a 3D shade contributes to clarifying something, but you don't, then your principle has nothing to say at that point. Meanwhile, the data/ink ratio does. It's by no means alone among principles in being over-zealously applied. But that's not a problem of the principle, it's a problem with the people applying it.

<a href="http://twitter.com/gilgongo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jonathan</a> says…
>	So what do you do when you see a principle being mis-applied or overly-applied? Conclude that the principle itself is wrong? Personally, I would conclude the person applying the principle is wrong, but Robert disagrees.

Meic Goodyear says…
>	Principles I try to follow:
>	- Since any aspect of a chart is capable of conveying information to a reader, only those aspects intended to carry such information should be included. For example, if graduated colours are used the graduation should indicate something about the data represented (eg probability density)
>	- Aspects and components of charts should be given visual prominence according to their importance to the message.
>	- Components should be as clearly interpreted as possible (eg horizontal rather than vertical text if formatting allows).
>	- Avoid redundancy (e.g. don't repeat info already in chart headings in axis labels)
>	- Additional non-chart features may be added if (a) they cannot be interpreted as conveying informations and (b) they are likely to added to the retention of the information in the memory of the reader (see Frances Yates's "The Art of Memory" for inspiration)

>	The data ink /  chart junk concept is really useful but ignores issues of psychology and visual acuity.  Negative space can be an asset, even in presenting data visually.  "Eye chart" papers and slides may be purely data, but if you can't find the message for the clutter, you're in trouble.

>	One item an end-user would like to include is the explanation (i.e. formula) for how a KPI was calculated.  Similar to a regression formula but in this case the explanations &amp; formula are on the "intro" page.   I've tried to convince him this is actually documentation and has no place in the dashboard.  In fact the data-ink ratio for the intro page is 0%
