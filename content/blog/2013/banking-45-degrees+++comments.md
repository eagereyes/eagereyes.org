>	Interesting study; good to see some fundamental work here. I do wish they had used adjacent pairs for their full time series tests instead of all pairs of segments, as it seems more likely the former models real world situations. I'm wondering as I read whether it would make a difference. On the one hand there should not be a systematic difference in average angle comparisons, but on the other the judgement of angles for unconnected lines should be very different from the judgement of an angle between two connected segments.

There is a large body of work on "what makes a good projection" and it might be interesting to feed the segments produced by such projections into a tool that measures the angle differences.

>	I've been banking to 45 since reading Cleveland's book many years ago. I hadn't seen Talbot, Gerth, and Hanrahan's article. Thanks for the interesting update!

>	Does banking to 45 degrees really work? We provide a dual-scaling banking for the user to choose aspect ratios for any input 1D curves ? http://www.yunhaiwang.org/bankto45/RobustAspectRatios.html
