>	Nice contribution to Computer, congratulations!  :-)  I see that you also address this interesting question of how to integrate interaction in storytelling.  In [1], we related this question to the "narrative paradox" (according to Aylett, 1999) and discussed (1) passive story consumption, (2) story playback with interactive approval, (3) semi-interactive story playback, and (4) total separation from the story in the terms of how the story decouples from its original line during telling.  Maybe that's something you find interestingly fitting to your ideas about how to make storytelling interactive?
