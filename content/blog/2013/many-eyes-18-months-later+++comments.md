>	As an amateur blogger who likes visualizations, I used Many Eyes a few times in the past, and always thought the results were beautiful and effective, if slow to load. I went back yesterday and today, though, and ran into a problem which, who knows, might explain your observation about the number of data sheets per visualization increasing. (I actually ran into this blog post when googling for solutions/explanations, though your whole blog looks interesting and I'll stick around to read a few more!)

The visualization is then replaced with an "Error. Click for details" message which, when clicked, again shows an "application blocked/untrusted application" warning, which actually seems one of Java's (red) more serious warnings. I recently updated Java and my security settings are simply the default ones, so I imagine others might run into this too..

In the past I used OpenHeatMap as a really low-threshold quick web tool to create an embeddable map, but it's a very plain tool, only for maps, and I think is just kept up as a legacy project by the creator as a favour. Infogr.am doesn't do maps, I think. So I'm always looking for alternative online visualization tools that are.easy to use for a non-programming amateur.
