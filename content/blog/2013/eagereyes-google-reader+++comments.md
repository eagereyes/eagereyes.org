>	For the DIY-minded, I've had a look at some self-hosted alternatives and have started using Selfoss (http://selfoss.aditu.de/). It's bit buggy here and there (tags not working right now for instance), but it's in active development. Has a mobile client and an API as well. I just have it running on my home PC on my DSL line and it works pretty good.
