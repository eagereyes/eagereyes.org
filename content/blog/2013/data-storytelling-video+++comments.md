While geographic maps of pollution data were helpful, it was difficult to understand the pollution transport with static images of maps changing over time. For this situation computer generated video was critical to understanding the air pollution transport. At our US EPA Scientific Visualization Center in the 1990s, we generated computer generated visualizations showing the hourly average distribution of reactive pollutant emissions.  The design of the visual display remained constant through all of the frames, so that attention was devoted completely to shifts in the data.  We used discrete color scales to show pollution values. Twenty-four hours  or more of an air pollution data model run would be organized into the time series visual display to view the changes in the pollutant concentrations over time.  A map of the geographic region of the air pollution transport would be overlayed over the visualization to understand in what direction the air pollution was moving.  We basically had weather model type movies of air pollution concentrations.  These videos were (and likely continue to be) critical to helping environmental scientists understand pollution transport.  Video of time series displays provided something that static geographic (GIS) systems could not.

Twenty-three hours of Los Angeles air pollution are organized into this display, based on computer generated video tape.  Shown is the hourly average distribution of reactive hydrocarbon emissions. The design remains constant through all of the frames, so that attention is devoted entirely to shifts in the data."

It was a dramatic display of regional pollution transport that demonstrated the need for air pollution control at the federal level since the air pollution crossed state boundaries easily. The visualization work supported policy setting activities like the Clean Air Act at the United States Federal Government Level. Issues like Acid Rain and Regional Oxidant concentrations were depicted with these time series animations and visualizations.

>	I wonder if next generation visualization tools will offer pre-scripted transitions and animations like in these videos, but in combination with the ability for users to at any point stop the script and use the tool interactively to explore the data on their own, possibly drawing new conclusions, and possibly recording their own new script and sharing it on the Web. Food for thought ;)
