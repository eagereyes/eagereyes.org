Vee says…
>	I verified my student status and already got this email with a download link -&gt; Your Tableau Desktop Product Key is Enclosed , but apparently that there is no enclosed product key.
>	I sent email to Liz, tft@tableausoftware.com and still get no response. So I have no idea how to activate the product without its key. I would really appreciate for any helps. :)
