>	Wonderful writeup here.  I think it is important, as a statistician, to understand when using a mean is appropriate (versus say the median), and also how to include additional information that will put that mean into context (such as standard deviation, confidence intervals, etc.).  I also think that the recent advances in data visualization solves some of the problem here.  We no longer have to constrain ourselves to a few statistics to tell a story... why not paint a picture using the data?
