>	Thank you for preparing a fun and informative discussion on the field of computer generated visualization.  As you wisely note, statistical graphics and cartography were examining the concepts of "visualization" prior to the evolution of compute generated solutions. It could also be said that hand drawn animation and story telling was doing it as well. Then we could also include the contributions of architects and engineers when it came to designing buildings and mechanical structures - they were doing "visualization".

Some people in the area of "mind power" speak of visualization as " a mental rehearsal where you create images in your mind of having or doing a desired objective". This kind visualization has been around for a long time and does not require computer science. Happily, computer generated visualization has been very helpful in expanding the horizons of mental visualization.

>	This is a really good post Robert. I have always considered Bertin and Tukey proceeding down equivalent paths having many of the same ideas about analysis. There are lots of advancements that have value beyond boiling them into the next software feature. The statement on taking bespoke examples and learning from them is an idea that our field needs to embrace. Many fields of research learn from taking a very high quality example of something and dissecting it to understand why it works so well. We can learn a lot by studying a single Rosling. The ten thousand knock-offs that came after it are not going to tell us any more than the original. Your post provides and reminds how wide and rich the field is if we open our mind and take a look around.
