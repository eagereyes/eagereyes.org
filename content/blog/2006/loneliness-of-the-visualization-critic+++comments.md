But the question here is not just that, but what the actual basis for that research is, what we can do to improve it, etc. Colin Ware in particular has some very interesting ideas  in that direction. </p>

And many "hard scientists" are not comfortable with discussing the scientific rigor of their work---what they do, to them, is by definition scientific. A good many people would benefit from a history of science course for this very reason---it is hard to be take what you do as science for granted when you realize what we have allowed to be called "science" in the past.
