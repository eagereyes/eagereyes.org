>	<p>Nice to read that parallel sets attract attention (again) -- indeed I still think that this approach is a step forward in dealing with categorical data (in visualization).  Maybe also the Set'o'gram, as presented last year at the InfoVis conference (and published in Freiler et al., Interactive Visual Analysis of Set-Typed Data; TVCG 14(6):<span>1340-1347), is adding to this strand of new visualization opportunities. </span></p>

>	<p>It's easy to represent the Titanic data with a bar graph showing percent (or probability) surviving on the ordinate, and separate bars for each of the eight categories of those on board. You can also manipulate bar width to reflect the relative proportions of each category. Different fill for the two genders also makes it easy to see if gender makes a difference in trends over class of accommodation.</p>
>	<p>When I put the bar graph side by side with the ParSet version it seems to me that it does a much better job of showing what the data reveal. No doubt this is in part because of the greater familiarity of bar graphs, but also because it allows showing the calculated probabilities of survival.</p>

>	<p>In most cases, high-dimensional categorical data can be best displayed in mosaic plots or a variant of mosaic plots. Parallel sets and the-like face the same adjacency problems as parallel coordinate plots and have a hard time dealing with large differences in sizes as the lines only scale in one dimension, tiles in mosaic plots scale in two dimensions.</p>

>	<p>The news about releasing the software to allow us to replicate such charts for data is most definitely welcome! Can we have a sneak preview even if the application is still in alpha version? :)</p>

>	<p>I read the article on the BBC website and was very interested. Your parallel sets graphing technique is a powerful tool in summarising multiple bits of information on the same graph.</p>
