>	<p>1. <strong>Anomalies, not raw termperature please</strong>: As I pointed out in my comment on your previous climate data post, when working with multiple stations, you need to work with temperature anomalies not readings to get any meaningfull results of long term temperature changes.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>I used the word "deny" on purpose, but I wasn't going anywhere near implying that people are Nazis. What would be the connection? The way "Nazi" is becoming a general term for people you don't like is not very helpful (or appropriate).</p>
>	<p>The issue is clearly much more complex, but I didn't want to go there. The data shows that temperatures are rising, that's a first step. It doesn't show why. I might look at more data, but probably not this year. The point of this was not to create the be-all-end-all visualization of all available data, but to look at one specific data set.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>I simply wanted to look at this new data set. I haven't looked into the anomalies, and need to do more reading on the matter. I don't see how you can measure anomalies by comparing to a baseline period that is so recent, for example, and that already showed considerable temperature change.</p>
>	<p>Thanks for the links, I'll look at those visualizations. It just strikes me that these are mostly heatmaps (which I find rather useless) or cluttered time series charts. I wanted to do something a bit different here.</p>

David Janes says…
>	<p>I have some regrets that I added that point, since I'm interested in where you are going with this and not trying to be trolling. To answer the question: the phrase climate change denial appears to deliberately evocative of the phrase "Holocaust Denial".</p>

>	<p><strong><em>"I don't see how you can measure anomalies by comparing to a baseline period that is so recent, for example, and that already showed considerable temperature change."</em></strong></p>
>	<p> </p>
>	<p>Climate trends show a multi-decadal variation, so a 30 periiod is usually used for the baseline. This is important when you are adding together several stations. A 1 C anomaly in Washington DC is the same as a 1 C anomaly in Boston. Both are 1 C above their respective baseline values.</p>
>	<p>Climate science is trying to understand changes locally, regionally and globally. How can we realistically compare temperature trends in Alaska and Florida, Alaska is much colder than Florida? We really want to see how their trends compare.</p>
>	<p>This is particularly important when we consider polar amplification. The farther north the greater the temperature anomaly change. I writtten a little more about this here:</p>
>	<p>http://chartsgraphs.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/temperature-anomaly-data-displays/</p>
>	<p>The period used for the baseline is arbitrary and does not affect the trend comparison. If you  used a 1891-1920 baseline rather than a 1961-1990 period, the plots would be offset vertically, however the trend slopes  would be the same.</p>
>	<p>This is what actually occurs today: NASA GISS uses 1951-1980, Hadley uses 1961-1990. The trends are comparable; there is a slight vertical offset between the two anomaly series.</p>
>	<p>When comparing anomaly data, we say that there has been X change from the baseline period.</p>

>	<p>In your tableau workbook, you have an alternate view of the seasonal trends by decade that I think may work better. It's the bar version (worksheet name 'Month Bars'). If you convert the decade dimension on the color shelf to continuous then you get more color options and can create more visual separation between the early decades vs. the later decades. This helps distinguish the individual decades and combats the overplotting without destroying the trended view.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>I tried different color palettes also for the lines, but when using different hues it quickly becomes difficult to see which way time moves forward. The reason I didn't use the bars is that the bar size distorts the effects a bit. The bars are really squares, so to make them large enough also means making them higher, so the overall difference looks larger. I didn't want to get accused of exaggerating an effect. ;) I'll try the continuous idea for the lines, though.</p>

>	<p>Lawrence Solomon's climate skeptical book is called The Deniers, based on his column on climate skeptical views in The National Posts called The Deniers.</p>
>	<p>I'm not sure use of the term "Deniers" is a deliberately aggressive attempt to dub skeptics as crypto-nazis.</p>

<a href="http://blog.instantcognition.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Clint</a> says…
>	<p>ok, on the bar distortion - definitely a risk. looks like it works on the lines as well. I set the decade to continuous on the color shelf - changed the palette to Red-Blue Diverging (reversed so that the later decades are in the red range) and used 10 steps.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>Can we leave the Nazis alone now and get back to climate data?</p>

<a href="http://i-ocean.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">derek</a> says…
>	<p>I think your 6 row by 1 column panel graph of temperatures would work better as a 3 row by 2 column panel graph. There would be twice as much vertical distance to differentiate the decade lines with, and each region would be no more than two rows apart from another region for visual comparision purposes, instead of up to five rows apart. I don't think the factor of 4 change in the aspect ratio (6:1 --&gt; 3:2 = 2/(1/2) = 4) would make the curves too tall.</p>

<a href="http://euphemize.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Joel</a> says…
>	<p>I'm not sure it is. You "deny" a charge in the legal world, links with Nazism and the holocaust are invoked by those who do not want to claim that they deny a link may exist between the release of CO2 (and other GHG locked up for many millenia) into the atmosphere and the warming of the globe.</p>
>	<p>To be even more fair, those opposed to action to reduce our output of GHGs cannot come to an agreement that the earth is warming or not, let alone the potential causes of it (if they then accept, based on evidence to date, that it does/may exist).</p>

WY says…
>	<p>The data for Asia looks quite different from the others. Maybe the data need to be further QCed. It's tempting to speculate the upward jump in Asia around 1990, but nothing can be really said without the assurance of data quality. Since it's a large continent, it might be helpful to look at the stations in Russia, Japan and India seperately (very few stations in China though)...</p>
>	<p> </p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>Thanks for the suggestion! Now I wish I could do transparency too, because the overplotting is actually a bit problematic.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>I don't want this to turn into a long argument over the use of a term. I agree with what you're saying, but my focus here is something else; and I'd rather change a word than have a pointless discussion on a topic completely unrelated to the posting and data.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>If it were wide enough, it would work, but it would make the reduced image on the page (without clicking it) too small to really see anything. I also have to say I like the current aspect ratio of the charts, anything higher would feel exaggerated.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>The distinction between Asia and Pacific seems rather arbitrary to me, and certainly has an effect on the averages. There is certainly more to be done here, also for Asia vs. Europe: it's not like there's a climate wall between those two, either.</p>

Human Powered says…
>	There may be more to the sampling question than we realize.  Although there are many sites the actual coverage is quite small and non-random.  I suspect the measurement sites were established because people lived there and wanted to know the temperature making this essentially a convenience sample.  
>	
>	Perhaps the point is that it's getting hotter where people live, but that is different than saying the whole world is getting hotter, what happens to the trends if you look only at sites where the human population is stable?
>	  
>	On the flip side if the temperature gains are greater in populated areas that would support the assertion that people are responsible for global warming.
>	
>	The sample frame bothers me more than I suspected going into this.  having only 443 sites with a non-random distribution could seriously skew the data, but to be honest I don't know enough about how the data is collected to be certain.  If anyone knows more about this I'd like to hear it.

Larry says…
>	<p>There is little that can be learned from the chart exercise. The topic is far more nuanced. For example, we lost several thousand reporting stations in Russia during the early 1990's. You don't tie the stations to citing, which means that many will be contaminated through Urban Heat Island effect. (Los Angeles has a steady increase while a station 25 miles away does not.) We know that the Chinese got their data way wrong also in a famous case and peer reviewed study. (The Chinese said the stations were fixed in location, but later determined to have been moved around severeal times.)</p>
>	<p>You mentioned 'going back to the 1970's' -- the problem there is that virtually anyone promoting AGW will use 1970 as a baseline, because it was in a decliing period of temperature. Therefore, by choosing the 1970 as a starting point, one can bend the graph to make a case simply by selective end points. (1934 was the hottest year in the US in the 20th century, and many of the hottest years were before the 1970's. This is why you won't see them on AGW charts.)</p>
>	<p>Other issues -- the real increase in carbon fuel-generated CO2 didn't start until the late 1940s. So, you have to accomodate this in terms of explanation.</p>
>	<p>Perhaps most importantly, we have been in a near-constant rise since the 1850s when we started coming out of the Little Ice Age. So, we have warming without CO2 being the driver. Therefore, looking at a long timeline, one cannot make the cause and effect argument. We've also had a plateau in temperatures, with no statistical increase in more than a decade. Same with sea level temps.</p>
>	<p>Other issues -- the HadCrut temperatures are not agreeing with radiosonde and satellites, with the latter two in agreement. We also know from Lindzen/Choi 2009, Knorr at Bristol 2009, and others that the anthropogenic CO2 is not increasing as a proportion of total natural CO2, and also that CO2 atmospheric escape is higher than any of the IPCC models. Meanwhile, troposphere temperatures should be heating under CO2 warming theory, but there is no 'hot spot' as predicted.</p>
>	<p>In terms of citing of stations, the US is considered the gold standard. Yet nearly 90% of our stations can't meet the government citing specs. Anthony Watts has a national project collecting information on the stations, and basically you will want to just about toss any data from them. Please review www.surfacestations.org</p>
>	<p>Another issue is that you report that you're utilizing the raw data from CRU. This couldn't be true in terms of all the raw data. Univ of East Anglis admits throwing away much of the raw temerature data. What is availalble are the revised figures whih were kept while the originals, stored on paper and magnetic tape, were destroyed to save space when moving to a new building. Therefore, scientists cannot check the basic calculations which show a long-term rise in temperature over the past 150 years. We also won't trust the CRU data easily, as the loss of the raw data was only released begrudingly after requests for the data under Freedom of Information legislation. 	 <!-- END: Module - M24 Article Headline with no image --> <!-- BEGIN: Module - Main Article --> <!-- Check the Article Type and display accordingly--> <!-- Print Author image associated with the Author--> <!-- Print the body of the article--></p>

>	<p>Although you are showing stations purportedly back 300 years, again, this ending in the early 1970s. Therefore, for natural reasons, the earth warmed, much as it is cooling now, owing to solar and cosmic ray cycles.</p>
