>	<p>first of all, thanks a lot for your work on Parallel Sets which I believe will prove to be a very useful tool!</p>

When I try to import <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/872077/parsets/refugees_2006-2008.csv">this file</a> with ParallelSets 2.1, it crashes. With the version 2.0 the file import works, but the data is not visualized in the way I expect it to. Each record in the dataset is a refugee flow from one contry to another. With Parallel Sets I'd like to be able to quickly compare the numbers of refugees moving from country to country. But when I import <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/872077/parsets/only_refugees_2008.csv">this simplified dataset</a> <a href="http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/872077/parsets/csv_import.png">marking the refugees column as "numerical"</a> it seems that the values in the "Refugees" column are just ignored in the vizualization and only the numbers of records with the corresponding values in the "Country of origin..." and "Country of asylum..." fields are counted instead.</p>
>	<p>For example, I'd like to compare the numbers of refugees coming from different countries to Austria and Switzerland. Here is what I get. All of the flows have the same width which is not very useful:</p>

>	<p>Thanks for the report, and sorry for the problems. I'll look into it. We're probably going to do a bugfix release soon, because there's a problem in the parser when there is a line with a different number of columns, and that will also include a fix for this.</p>
