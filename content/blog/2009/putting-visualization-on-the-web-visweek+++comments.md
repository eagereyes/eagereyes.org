>	<p>Sounds like a great workshop and conference. On a separate but related topic, I'm looking for proposals from any readers who want to get paid to produce a series of high quality information graphics with a dynamic non-profit organization. We're looking for serious work from graphics professionals and we're willing to pay appropriately. Any questions, see our RFP at the link above, or our ad on Flowing Data, or email me at washington@eastwestcenter.org.</p>

I figure you can look at the server logs and see that, but from the registrant perspective, it looks like the request simply didn't go through.
