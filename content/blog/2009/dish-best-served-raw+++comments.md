>	<p>I agree, and data.gov is really only usable for a small minority of people. But the raw data is where it all begins. Now people can start building interesting applications and new ways to disseminate the data. But without that raw data, none of that is possible: nobody's going to read endless PDFs with pre-digested tables, and nobody is going to be able to build anything more interesting from them.</p>
