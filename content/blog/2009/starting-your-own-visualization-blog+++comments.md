>	<p>I split the difference. I use Wordpress, but hosted on my web hosts servers. Like many hosts, they provide 'one click" installation so setting it up is painless. True, I have to stay on top of updates and the like, but that's been made pretty easy these days. It doesn't cost any more than what I'm already paying for hosting, and I always have access to my files for backups and the like.</p>
>	<p>I must say, though, if I knew I could get some backend access to my content for backing up, I would definitely go for something like Tumblr. My concern with them, though, is what happens to everything I've posted if they shut down?</p>

It's a valid concern, but it's also quite easy to just get the content through some web archive program or RSS archiver, so there are many easy ways of creating backups.</p>
