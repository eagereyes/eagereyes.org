>	<p>I know you're biased heavily in favour of analysis, but I think in your haste to defend science and define away "pretty pictures" you understate the role that exploratative visualisation has in generating good forms for analysis. The <em>process</em> is the visualisation... not the answers.</p>
>	<p>Sure, the outcome of many explorations ends with the visuals and stops short of what you call "actual" analysis but you won't succeed in leading people to analysis by passively belittling everyone who doesn't get that far (and that's what you're doing, believe me). I respect that analysis is your goal but it's too limiting a definition for visualisation in general. It's a different set of skills and a lot harder, but it doesn't mean you should dismiss the learning and discovery that happens during a good exploration.</p>
>	<p>If I was you I would be worried about succeeding the definition game. Right now you're frustrated that too many people are calling their work visualisation but just wait until everyone hears your cries and starts calling their pretty pictures "visual analyisis" instead. You can chase definitions forever (and in academia you might be happy to do that) but at some point it's easier to just set a good example. What good examples of visual analysis are there? (No bad examples please, I don't care).</p>

>	<p>I agree with many of the things being said here Robert. I'm not so sure on the substitute label, but I think it's a very worthwhile discussion to have amongst ourselves.
