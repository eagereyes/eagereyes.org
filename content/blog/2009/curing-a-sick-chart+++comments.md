>	<p>Fry's fancy visualization required two separate interactions to reveal one data point at a time. Your first chart, the panels of patient count vs. age shows all of these points in a single view.</p>
>	<p>Too many visualizations use interaction like this, such that the view of the data is actually obscured by the visualization. But it gives the viewer a false sense of "Wow, I'm interacting here, cool!"</p>

>	<p>One way to make a bigger impact with graphics is to include a point of view, or maybe even a conclusion. For example, right now many people view Medicare as sacred, while believing that extending Medicare to children under 18 would lead the country to damnation. If you tweaked your charts just a bit (showing treatment cost per person, rather than cost per patient) it might shed some light on the financial tradeoffs involved in this question.</p>
>	<p>One nitpick: why on earth are you using bar charts for this data? It adds a huge amount of visual noise; using a filled line graph would be much easier on the eyes and make it far easier to see trends and patterns. It's also arguably closer to the truth, using linear interpolation to undo some of the distortion caused by binning the data.</p>

>	<p>I think there is benefit to both the stacked relative costs that add up to 100% as I used <a href="http://www.theusRus.de/Blog-files/TotalCostShare.png">here</a> as well as the "split up" version you use <a href="https://media.eagereyes.org/media/2009/sickchart/patients-age-disease-thumb.png">above</a>. A single mouse click should take you from one view to the other. The split up version definitely face the problem that you can not use the plot space very efficiently - a problem which all small multiples have.</p>
>	<p>(I wonder why you didn't show a comparison of the <a href="http://www.theusRus.de/Blog-files/PatShare.png">patients shared costs</a> and the <a href="http://www.theusRus.de/Blog-files/CostsPerPat.png">costs per patient</a> between diseases. These comparisons should have the highest potential of showing something interesting, which is not more or less obvious - and in fact there was not much of a story here)</p>

>	<p>Age 0 is actually a real datapoint, it's children under age 1. The databases that organizations like WHO put out use the same format. It'd actually be interesting to see the plots for age 0, because neonatal care is extraordinarily expensive.</p>
