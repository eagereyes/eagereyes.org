>	<p>Do you mean if it's true that I'm trying to learn to play the piano and reading a book on music theory? Yes, that's true. I'm not making a lot of progress lately, but I'm working on it. I also meant what I wrote about structure. It's basically all true except for the description of the new site.</p>
>	<p>Music theory is very abstract and I haven't found it to be much use for enjoying music yet. Though I'm sure that as I progress, I will get more out of it. I don't think that you can get much from it if you only do the theory though, you need the practical side to "get" the theory, IMHO.</p>
