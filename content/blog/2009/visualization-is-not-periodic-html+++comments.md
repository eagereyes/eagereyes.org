>	<p>Why did you cross out "Idiotic"? I have disliked these pseudo-scientific displays since the first one I ever ssaw. There's no periodicity, no order by row or column. Just some doofus pigeonholing items almost at random in a familiar grid.</p>

>	<p>It's nice to read an opinion of "The Periodic Table of Information Visualization" that is consistent with mine from another person working in the field. I wrote about the absurdity of this display back on <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=81">January 8th, 2007</a> and even used it as an example of the kind of display that gives infovis a bad name in my capstone presentation at InfoVis 2007. Until now, I have only read one other negative opinion besides yours, which was written by Juan D&uuml;rsteler in May, 2007. This display is so embarrassingly ineffective, it's surprising that when it was getting so much positive attention when it was first published that others working in our field didn't raise their voices to say that it did not represent what information visualization has to offer. Was this because academics are loathe to criticize the work of other academics? Isn't academia the proper place for such critique?</p>

>	To be honest, the visualization is as bad as several of the visualization it references. Academic rigor would call for a more decent classification - which definitely would not fit into the periodic system framework.

>	InfoVis has a certain artistic freedom which makes is often hard to classify. The "only" important dimension which might be left for any kind of visualization is the efficiency a visualization has in coding resp. decoding information.

>	<p>I remember reading your posting, I just didn't think of it when writing this. You're much more systematic about pointing out the flaws in this design.</p>
>	<p>But regarding criticism in academia: that would be a good idea. But in many cases, that is done in private, and usually without telling the person whose work is being discussed &ndash; unless it's a review, in which case the reviewer/critic is anonymous. We don't have a culture of criticism, and many people are in fact very adverse (critical?) of it. That's why I keep pushing the idea: if it was what everybody was doing, there would be no point in doing that.</p>

>	<p>You raise some good &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; points about the errors, omissions, and logic flaws of this particular representation. But at the same time I wonder if this is the best way for a community of infovis practitioners to &ldquo;criticize&rdquo; the works of others. Reminds me a bit of walking through a museum and saying &ldquo;that painting sucks&rdquo; - can you do better? Let us see your attempt to make better of a valid goal to provide a useful visualization of visualization methods. I&rsquo;m sure you could count on the community to provide useful and constructive inputs to make it better and therefore benefit the effort...the best challenge to nonsense is to make sense...</p>

>	Speaking as a designer with a science background, it particularly annoys me when someone takes the form of something like the periodic table, which is a brilliant piece of information design conveying a large and complex amount of data about a specific phenomenon, throws out the content and shoehorns in new content which has no reason to be presented in that form. They've used it simply because it's a pre-existing familiar, memorable and structured visual representation - a quick and easy way to jump on a bandwagon. I did once see a version of the periodic table with each element illustrated by a food that contained it. That was meaningful, a periodic table of visualization methods isn't.

>	One example that has particularly incensed me for years is The Great Bear, an artwork by Simon Patterson. Based on the London Underground Tube diagram, the lines have been labelled with categories and the stations with the names of people who fit within those categories. I realise that it's an artwork designed to question the meaning of categories and labelling, but it still really bugs me that he didn't make the intersections work properly. For instance, he could have structured it so that the intersection between philosophers and footballers was Albert Camus, but didn't. Why would you pass up that opportunity? It seems like a good idea let down by poor execution, although maybe part of the point was to irritate pedants like me... (And yes, I start to have a go at redoing it myself: it's quite difficult!)
