>	<p>Given <a href="http://www.research.att.com/areas/visualization/people/">where I am now</a>, I'll personally try to balance Vis and InfoVis. But be sure to complain! I am about to figure out how to add devices to twitter, and so there is likely going to be more people tweeting as well (until about 6 weeks ago my cell phone did not even have SMS support - don't ask :)</p>

>	<p>So glad you guys are blogging this event.  I'm quite envious, and wish I was going.  I've tried live blogging before...not easy, so extra points to you.  I have seen techcrunch write about how they use cover it live.  Very curious if you use anything special or just blog your fingers off.</p>
>	<p>Cant' wait to read blogs and tweets!</p>

>	<p>... are not what we are using ;) It's just a few folks with laptops and enough spare time on their hands. It might not be all that real-time (see <a href="/blog/2008/lessons-learned-from-live-blogging-visweek-2008">last year</a>), and we're not going to post pictures of new products the second they are revealed. But we'll do our best to provide pointers to people who are not there, comment on what's going on, and give you some idea what you're missing.</p>

>	<p>Great effort summarising all live-blogging and twitter efforts in this post Robert!  I sure am looking forward to linking up with all of you next week, that is to say if I can find time between all that staring at my little netbook screen typing away. :P</p>
>	<p>I'll definitely make use of the #visweek hashtag.</p>
