# VisWeek Preview: Visualization on the Web Workshop

The workshop <em>Putting Visualization on the Web</em> will be held on Sunday, October 11, from 2pm to 5:30pm at <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2009/">VisWeek 2009</a>. If you are there on Sunday, please join us for discussions on everything related to visualization, blogging, web-based visualization, and a whole lot more. You do not have to register for the workshop separately, and you are welcome whether you submitted a position paper or not.

The program for the workshop is still only preliminary, but check back later this week for more details. We will make the position papers and the results of the discussions available as a report after the workshop. If you want to shape the way the world sees visualization on the World Wide Web, drop by and join the discussion!
