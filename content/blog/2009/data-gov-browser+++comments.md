>	<p>Hi Robert,</p>
>	<p>Cool applet, thanks for sharing!  I've posted <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/files/DataGov%20browser.twbx">a Tableau workbook I built</a> for browsing Data.gov for files that work well with Tableau (at this point only .csv/.xls).  It was most recently updated on 6/15/2009, so it will need occasional refreshes from the latest metadata.</p>
