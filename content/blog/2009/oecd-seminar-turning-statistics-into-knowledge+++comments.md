>	Thanks for the review. I was there as well and I think I agree with your overall assessment. I am an astronomer and an avid consumer of visualization and I had hoped for a little better at the conference. I think, as you mentioned, many talks were off-topic in that they really did not address what I believe is the REAL issue: the "how" you turn stats into knowledge.
>	Nevertheless, I think it was a rather interesting conference that underscored the role that massive amounts of data are playing in our society by forcing us to reconsider many of approaches to data collection and analysis.

>	I think you underestimate the importance of David Speigelhalter's work.  There is a large body of work (particularly by Tversky and Kahneman) showing that our intuition is terribly bad when it comes to understand probabilities and translating to natural frequencies can make a big difference.

Robert Kosara says…
>	I have no doubt that our intuition is bad with regards to probabilities, but I would like to see some proof that this particular visualization actually helps. And I'm not even necessarily doubting it, I just think it needs to be evaluated.
>	Watching the talk, my conclusions were also different from David Spiegelhalter's: when he showed how taking a particular medication would save two people out of 100, I thought: if one them is me, that's totally worth it! He didn't seem to think so. I wonder how that kind of discrepancy would factor into a user study.

>	Thanks for posting your comments. I, too, enjoyed the seminar, but took a slightly different tact in <a href="http://blog.balinsbooks.com/2009/07/24/turning-statistics-into-knowledge-seminar-review-and-notes/" target="_blank">my comments</a>, which focus on the technical side of things like XML, Flash, databases, etc.
>	Good seminar. I hope to attend it again in the future, if it's ever around here again (I attended on my own, not through my work).

>	Far enough.  I think this is a fairly active field in psychology, so perhaps people are already doing the research.

>	Your post misses the point about a lot of important contributions from the workshop. My interpretation of turning information into knowledge, in the context of this meeting was how to inform masses of people. In this regard, Ben Fry's example of projecting a shape onto the smoke stack of a power plant is spot on. I'm very curious about the public's reaction, and whether the installation did indeed result in reduced energy consumption by residents. I would like to think that it made the connection between energy use and power plant emission concrete for local residents.

>	A few comments about how backward the USA is were raised but I was glad to see these parried. What is so excellent about many government agencies in the US is that they put their actual data out for public consumption. Several European countries and even my home country Australia are simply posting visual and tabular summaries. This is so frustrating, because they   typically do a lousy job with the graphics and tables. Who are they to say what I want to know - give me the data and I can find out for myself. Its a trade-off like "give a person a fish and they eat for the day, give a person a fishing rod and they eat for a lifetime".  I was also cringing at some of the graphics showed by developers. One thing I try to remind myself, though, is at least people are trying to do data visualization.

>	I had a good discussion with several people from BLS and there is a general problem that I've noticed in industry and government. A number of years ago Dan Carr worked with BLS on converting tables to charts and linked micromaps - very elegant work. I was sorry to hear during the meeting that this work is not used any more. He and Dan Rope provided software for the methods, but there was no-one at BLS who was in charge of keeping the software working or supporting users. It was incorporated into commercial software, nVizN, but that company dissolved. If there is going to be a fruitful, sustainable exchange of ideas, collaborations with academia need to have a full partner from the other side, the small test software produced by academia needs to be developed and maintained by the interested party.

>	In response to yours and Hadley's exchange above.  Spiegelhalter's work is in many ways similar to  Ben Fry's, trying to boil down complex data into something simple and understandable by the masses, only its done through the use of probability rather than art. One of his images does remain imprinted in my mind: the chart of the distance a cyclist, motorcyclist or car goes before a fatal crash. The risk is that the symbolism is too simplistic.

>	Thanks for the nice things you said about my talk. It was very difficult to decide on what to say in a 15 minute talk to such a hugely varied audience. I too felt isolated - Naomi Robbins was the only other statistical graphics person. I thought everyone was from info vis! And you say otherwise. I do think that the organizers of events like this are to be congratulated. It really was a forum for exchange of ideas in a very diverse environment.

>	This is exactly the trend I've seen online and in most conferences to date. I think its wonderful there is such a diversity of techniques and visualizations out there, however, when visualization prowess becomes the chart junk of understanding, I think we're headed in the wrong direction. The degree to which people understand and correct behavior is the the degree of usefulness. Graphic treatment of statistical information becomes knowledge when meaningful action is taken and it seems there are gravely more people getting excited about putting data into pictures (because they can) than working to understand the response of their audience. Though, I have to admit, it is tantalizing seeing the visual boundaries being pushed in the info viz community.

>	Thanks for the great summary of the seminar.  We decided not to send anybody from Swivel (as we're working very hard on getting our new product out).  Thus this summary was quite useful.
>	To contribute some findings from our own qualitative research, we've found that there are three things that are important to turning statistics into knowledge.
>	<ol>
>	<li>Visualization - you need to be able to see the numbers in order to understand them (this includes being able to quickly scan through tables, as well as fancier graphical representations).</li>
>	<li>Interaction - you need to be able to engage with the data, shape it, and see it from different angles.  Playing with the data really lets you focus on what the numbers are saying.</li>
>	<li>Communication - especially in businesses, real understanding of data happens when results are shared and presented.  Collaboration that happens before a big presentation, as well as feedback that is taken away from that presentation are all integral to understanding.</li>
>	</ol>
>	Finally, a personal data point.  Experimentation is essential.  Having access to all the historical data in the world is not as useful as having a lab to test hypotheses in.  Having access to historical data may let you make educated guesses about causes and results, but running experiments can give you proof.

>	I was not at the workshop, but I agree and sympathize with your feelings regarding lack of evaluation and tools. I feel that academics have a responsibility to bring free, accessible tools to the public. I think that one hindrance we have is the lack of coherent recommendations. Reading the literature, I find a lot of great ideas, but I have yet to see a set of recommendations that could become guidelines for a distributed open-source effort, for example.
>	I have been working with the intermedia arts community, and they are developing recommendations for university media labs. This community then will be able to take these recommendations to their administrators to justify the effort and costs. Similarly, if the visualization community (diverse as it is) could articulate the features and use cases for end-user visualization tools, I know it would help researchers like me in getting support from my institution, as well as funding agencies, for the efforts.
