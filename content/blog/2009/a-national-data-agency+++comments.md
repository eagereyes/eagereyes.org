>	<p>I do hope everyone here knows the work Carl Malamud has done to make government information freely accessible in a machine-friendly form. If we ever do get a National Data Agency -- which I think is a terrific idea -- I can't imagine anyone who could do a better job at it. For once Carl would be directing the bureaucracy rather than having to fight it.</p>

>	<p>Carl Malamud is doing excellent individual work; I would also strongly suggest that you read about the Sunlight Foundation ( <a href="http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/">http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/</a> ), which explores this idea in fascinating detail. Sunlight is rapidly turning into the center for tracking and distributing government sources of information.</p>

>	<p>This type of agency would be a wonderful help for me. When I want to find economic data for my site VisualizingEconomics (even when the data is in a database or excel spreadsheet) I end up with a long list of government sites: BEA, CBO, Fed Reserve, Census,  BLS, CIA not to mention World Bank and IMF data. Each with different interfaces for downloading the data into different formats. And while there are attempts to gather this type of econmic data in one place (like Economagic) I don't think any private organization can ever be the central repository.</p>
