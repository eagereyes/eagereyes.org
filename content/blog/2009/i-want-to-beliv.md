# I Want to BELIV

Evaluation of visualization systems and techniques is a vital part of visualization research, but is often neglected. While there are established methods for basic perception studies, many other kinds of questions are much more difficult to answer in a controlled study. The CHI workshop <a href="http://www.beliv.org/beliv2010/">BELIV (BEyond time and errors: novel evaLuation methods for Information Visualization)</a> is the place to discuss new ideas about evaluating visualization.

Evaluation is not a panacea, especially when it comes to complex visualization application. There are also new kinds of visualization that require us to rethink how to evaluate them in the first place. That includes visualization websites like <a href="http://many-eyes.com/">Many Eyes</a> just as much as visualizations in less traditional settings, like museums.

How do we know that these systems are useful? How can we compare them? Can we measure not just correctness and task completion time, but also engagement, learning, insights, and fun?

BELIV accepts two kinds of submissions: research papers and position papers. The workshop is part of <a href="http://chi2010.org/">CHI 2010</a>, which will take place in Atlanta, GA, April 10&ndash;15, 2010. The deadline for submissions is November 30, at 5pm PST.
