>	<p>The above single year 1969 compared to the single year 1999 is comparing weather years, not climate years.  The conclusion, "It's getting warmer." cannot be made based on the data selected.  Rather it can be observationally summarized that the year 1999 was warmer than the year 1969.  It is better for you to say that you have collected an observation and made a summary statement.  As this is only the first step in your scientific method, you have a long way to go before such a conclusion has you have postulated can be made.  Do you have an hypothesis as to why there is this difference between these two years?</p>
