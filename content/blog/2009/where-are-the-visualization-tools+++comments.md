>	<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana;">Many of the tools mentioned so far compare like apples and oranges. There is a big difference for the actual user of visualization tools between tools that are ready to use and solutions that have to be build upon toolboxes. </p>
>	<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana;">That takes me to a - what I think - very important point: <strong>The user's view</strong>. Most users of visualizations won't have the skills (or patience) to build customized visualizations out of toolboxes. No doubt, the examples Chris' built with Improvize are impressive and the wealth of interaction options we can choose from is huge. But when we sat down over a beer at a workshop evening to look at a new dataset, we didn't actually get far even after an hour - and this was not a tribute to the beer! Things get probably even harder when we would use prefuse and need to write JAVA code.</p>
>	<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana;">Another point is the distinction between general purpose tools (that try to cover as many data problems as possible) and special purpose tools which "only" support a very narrow range of data problems (but these in the most optimal way).</p>
>	<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; font: 10.0px Verdana;">Maybe the two above mentioned points are good dimensions along which we can classify the tools listed here.</p>

>	<p>I agree with Martin's comment above - there is an enormous overhead to using something like Prefuse (or Flare).  Even Processing, written for the programmer novices, has quite the heavy learning curve to start with for data work, as Ben Fry's O'Reilly infovis book on Processing illustrates. </p>

>	<p>You're right, I only realized that when people started posting links to Business Intelligence suites. I was thinking more of fairly small programs that you could run on some files you have lying around, not the db-centric, data warehouse kinds of things (though I realize that tools like Tableau can do both).</p>
>	<p>But there's a place for both, obviously. I'm trying to figure out a good way to structure such a list, so that people will find the things that make sense for them. It clearly doesn't hurt to have a place where you can find a hammer just as well as some heavy-duty power tools (which you might not even want to buy, but rather rent; yeah, maybe I'm taking the metaphor too far).</p>

>	R is great for visualization.  Once you learn the language and learn, for example, how to use the lattice package (this takes some time, but is very powerful once you know what you are doing), you are able to very quickly and powerfully create any kind of plot you can imagine.  If you're not willing to learn all that, I'm sure there are plenty of other very useful more wysiwyg-type programs out there. 
>	
>	Another very strong plus for R is that usually you can get a lot more out of your data visually by doing something with it (such as transforming, modeling, etc).  I can't think of a better package that gives you complete freedom and many tools to work with the data and visualize it at the same time.

<a href="http://www.theusRus.de" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Theus</a> says…
>	... I agree that R is a wonderful tool, but we are talking about visualizations which benefit strongly from interaction and animation here. None of the R packages has anything to offer on that part (less a fault of the packages, but more a problem of R's rendering machine ...)

timvangelder says…
>	<p>People interested in data visualization tend to think that or at least act as if visualization is all about data.  But the power of visualization can be applied to complex information structures other than "data" structures.  For example <a href="http://bcisive.austhink.com">bCisive</a> and <a href="http://rationale.austhink.com">Rationale</a> are tools for visualising argumentation structures, and there are many other argument mapping software packages.  Of a more general nature is mind mapping, and the plethora of mind-mapping packages. </p>
>	<p>Such tools tend to use hierarchical or "tree" structures (though both bCisive and Rationale are based on the idea that argumentation needs "hi-tree" structures (a special case of higraphs for tree-like structures).  However there is nothing intrinsic in argumentation requiring restriction to tree or hi-tree structures; these are design choices made for many reasons, including UI-design reasons. </p>

>	<p>Any opinions on the InfoVis Toolkit? It looks promising (and looks like one of the only open-source frameworks to support parallel coordinates) but doesn't seem to have been developed in several years, and I find that (even once I correct directory structures and so on) many of the example files don't even run (is this just my experience or is it true for other people as well?)</p>
>	<p>I've worked almost entirely in Processing for years, but I'm leaning toward a move to Flex with Flare -- like it or not, Flash seems to have won the web deployment wars, and Flex is a big step forward in developing for Flash from a programmer's perspective...and I have to say, with just a couple of days' experience, Flex Builder seems like a real pleasure to use.</p>

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>I haven't seen any activity in the InfoVis Toolkit in many years, I assume it's abandoned.</p>
>	<p>I haven't gotten the hang of Flash, and I really like the language features in Java. Java also makes it easier to create an actual application that looks and feels like a native program. For purely web-based stuff, Flash is probably the better choice, though.</p>

<a href="http://www.novonon.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Egg Davis</a> says…
>	<p>Oh, I agree entirely -- ActionScript has always felt really kludgy to me, kind of conceptually incoherent. Flex is a big improvement, but AS would *never* be my language of choice. I'm turning to it only because of the deployment issue (and, I'll confess, because Flare's rather sexy).</p>
