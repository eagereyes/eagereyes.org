# Sightings: A Vennerable Challenge

Venn diagrams are a strange mix of structure and data visualization. In my latest <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2009/1/a-vennerable-challenge"><em>Sightings</em> column</a> (<a href="http://amsciadmin.eresources.com/libraries/documents/200812151345447084-2009-01Kosara-Sightings.pdf">PDF</a>) for <em><a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/">American Scientist</a></em>, I use the example of a visualization challenge from last year to discuss different ways to show the same data about diagnosis techniques for autism in young children. This also sparked the launch of a new site feature: <a href="/ask"><em>Ask Eagereyes</em></a>.

Regular readers of this website will perhaps remember the <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2007/09/on-difficulty-of-autism-diagnosis-can.html">Autism diagnosis accuracy redesign challenge</a> originally posted on Nuit Blanche, which asked for better ways to show data that had been displayed in a Venn diagram. There were <a href="http://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/2007/10/judging-autism-charts-challenge.html">a number of interesting designs</a>, and I also <a href="/blog/2007/autism-diagnosis-accuracy">contributed one</a>. All of these were clearly better than the original, but I was most interested in the ones that showed the structure of the data. So I ended up talking about my own redesign as well as Patrick Murphy's redesign of mine.

<a href="/ask"><em>Ask EagerEyes</em></a> is an extension of what I am trying to achieve with <em>Sightings</em> (which I took over from Felice Frankel in the summer): to make the scientific community aware of information visualization and to get a better understanding of the problems scientists are facing in analyzing their data and communicating their results. The autism case study is a great example for the need for a better understanding of these questions.

But <em>Ask EagerEyes</em> is not limited to scientific data. If you have any kind of data you would like to understand better, or have a visualization of data that you think could be improved, drop me a note. The reason this is not part of a forum is that I want to make it possible to discuss problems that involve confidential or otherwise unpublished data. Eventually, of course, I hope to be able to talk about the problems posed and solutions found on this site. Some of the questions might also become challenges for my dear readers.
