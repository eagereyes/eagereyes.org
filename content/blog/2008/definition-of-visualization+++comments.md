Robert Kosara says…
>	Good points, but that's why I said "not immediately visible." A histogram, even if derived from something you can see, is more than trivially different from the photograph itself. A simple distortion of the image or filters that get applied to bring out certain structures would not be.

>	I'm not sure "invertable" is really true. I was thinking of "bijective" for some time, but obviously, that's not really the case in visualization. There are losses in the translation from data to the image. That's why I think "readable" is a better criterion, because it's not as strong as the other two, but still gets the idea across.

What you want to do is reduce the amount of information being presented, just focusing on the elements that are most important to communicating the message.

>	I really like the blog post and the paper, and I regret I did not come across them before. I particularly appreciate the clarity of the writing and of the thinking in the paper, that makes it easily accessible to a wide audience and really useful.
>	
>	Maybe one thing that disturbs me in the paper is the missing link between the sublime and the enigmatic. My understanding is that the sublime is what elicits awe, and the enigmatic is the quality of something that is difficult to interpret. I understand that there is some value in both, but the paper never clearly explains how are the two connected.
>	
>	Arguably, something hard to interpret can elicit a wide range of emotions and reactions, both positive (e.g., intellectual curiosity or amusement) and negative (e.g., frustration or indifference), many of which are not necessarily deep or related to awe. The converse idea that the sublime is necessarily caused by something that is hard to interpret is maybe more interesting, but not immediately obvious. Yet this is simply assumed in the paper, and quickly leads to the conclusion that a user-friendly visualization cannot be sublime. But is there any evidence for this?

>	Another comment I have is about the idea of introducing criticism and critical thinking in academic publications. Maybe it's worth recalling that those are hardly restricted to art and design and have always played a major role of science. As the paper suggests, academic peer-review is pure criticism.
>	
>	Now it's true that i) the quality of criticism in peer reviews is not consistently high and the guidelines proposed in the paper can be quite useful in rising the standards; ii) criticism only indirectly appears in academic (infovis) papers, as these papers are mostly crafted in order to dodge all possible criticism by peer reviewers. Explicit criticism in papers (of either one's own designs or someone else's) could certainly provide some added value when backed up by facts, but for this we would have to transcend the political correctness that so far has characterized the tone of academic publications in HCI disciplines. The many controversies and battles in disciplines such as psychology are sometimes mean but they are also very healthy, I think, for the progress of knowledge.

>	I'd add a lower bound criterion to your third point: a visualisation should be at the very least more readable than the underlying data in text/tabular form. Now, 'more readable' is in itself a multifaceted criterion, sure, but let's say the visualisation should enable either: reaching same conclusions faster; reaching better informed conclusions; easier communication of said conclusions; better long-term retention of information (important for education) etc.

JM says…
>	Something can be a visualization of the data without being 'more readable'.  Now, a _good_ visualization certainly should meet that criteria.

Minko says…
>	Good point on the misleading of "image." It is about reduction as our mind always works to wrap complexity in manageable portions. I'd offer the term "economy of communicating" as a function of the economy of brain power. Images wrap complexity for quicker processing with less energy. Meaning production works similarly in identifying relations by giving them a name. Value, in color theory for example, is the wrap-up for the relating between black and white. Two words replaced by one. Of course, the way images wrap up relations (data) is much more complex, however they are faster to process. Not sure if "reading" is an adequate term to the instant visual impact of images, but it is true that images can and are being read when it comes to illustrating and comprehending information. Other than that there's memorability, which often is mixed in the information visualization discourse only to introduce more confusion. It is incredibly irresistible the power of art, isn't it?!
