>	EagerEyes does look a lot like a blog :P. You've got the entries on the left and recent posts and comments in the sidebar and everything sort of flows like a blog. Maybe a homepage that shows a greater separation between what belongs to "blog" and what belongs to something else might help with the mistake?

>	<p>You're right, and I'm actually working on a design for the front-page that will make it look less bloggy. But I do like the list format, so there will still be pages that list articles from particular categories or just the "feed." It takes a ton of tweaking to combine the best of both worlds and find a good balance for how much stuff to show &ndash; and not be overpowering or look bare.</p>

>	Hi Robert, Congrats on crossing the 2 year milestone. It takes huge amounts of passion and commitment to keep on talking about topics you care about. Keep up the good work.

>	This trend has been a concern for me as well. But as I visit more blogs, follow discussions everywhere I am seeing a trend that may be we dont discuss unless we hate something or *strongly* like something. When the reaction is negative usually comments / discussion begin fast but when it is positive or neutral it takes greater energy to be part of the discussion. Dont you think so?

>	<p>I agree with your observations on comments, though that is actually something I talked about above: I've seen a few instances where postings on blogs or even more "serious" websites were quite obviously written to incite arguments and drive up "participation" and traffic. I just don't want to do that.</p>

>	I guess inciting / inspiring users to sit up and take notice of things is a technique most famous blogs use. But I more interested in proving the general phenomena of "negativity is more than positivity in comments" by taking a look at a cross section of comments from social sites (like youtube, reddit, digg, flickr and popular blogs lifehacker, smashingmagazine, readwriteweb etc.) and going through a hundred or so posts to analyze the content (look at the comments of these sites, take the words and rate them based on plus words or minus words) and then see if we can conclude something.

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>I'm sure you're right about the negativity. There was a study recently that said that people who tend to post comments are more likely the ones with extreme world views, whether they know anything about the actual subject or not. And they will more likely attack things they don't agree with, than slap the writer on the back. I can't seem to find anything on that right now, though.</p>
>	<p>There is software that can analyze text for positive/negative statements (and more than that), but I don't know any that's free (it's actually very expensive, because it's not exactly the kind of software that sells millions of copies). If you collect data, I might be able to get somebody to run that through such a program.</p>
