>	Interesting plots and amazing work digging out that data.  Neat trick using a stacked bar chart in this way -- very useful!  I know this was just a quick Excel attempt to show something, so take this with a grain of salt.  It's probably due to an automatic default in Excel, but I think the gray shadows on the colored bars make it look like a gray bar beside the colored bars.  An unfortunate coincidence of using gray for the non-multiple-of-five bars.
