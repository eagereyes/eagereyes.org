>	<p>You seem to have hit on something more than poetic. Our inclination for metaphors seems to be more of a use of our instinct or natural perseption, rather than a cute way to understand complex data.</p>
>	<p>We see shadows and implicitly know the time. We taste fruit and know if its poison due to bitterness. We pay attention to the moon, the stars, and the seasons.</p>
>	<p>In our world now, it seems we are void of ambient indicators, something that these metaphors my be offering. We may not be able to replace our instincts, but we can adapt our environment to give us appropriate clues.</p>

>	<p>Robert, are you reading your Calvin &amp; Hobbes again? :)</p>
>	<p>In one strip, Calvin says to Hobbes, "I've been reading about the beginning of the universe. They call it 'The Big Bang.' Isn't it weird how scientists can imagine all the matter of the universe exploding out of a dot smaller than the head of a pin, but they can't come up with a more evocative name for it than 'the Big Bang'? That's the whole problem with science. You've got a bunch of empiricists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder."<br /><br />Hobbes asks, "What would you call the creation of the universe?"<br /><br />Calvin replies, "The Horrendous Space Kablooie!"</p>
