# Visualization Day at City College of New York

The City College of New York will be hosting a <a href="http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/general/VisualizationDay.htm">visualization day</a> on April 30, with a very interesting line-up of speakers: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben/">Ben Shneiderman</a> (who is also listed as a sponsor), <a href="http://ericson.net/home/index.php">Matthew Ericson</a> (NY Times), <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/members/cplaisant/">Catherine Plaisant</a> (University of Maryland), <a href="http://bewitched.com/">Martin Wattenberg</a> (IBM/Many Eyes), and others.

Of course, this reminds of my own plans for not just a local, but a <a href="/blog/2007/we-need-a-world-visualization-day">world visualization day</a>. That one is on hold for the moment, but I hope to have some news in the near future. I have been asked about it by several people recently, and I am still convinced that there is a need for such an event. More to come soon ...
