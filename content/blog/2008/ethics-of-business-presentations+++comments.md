>	<p>I think it's a matter of integrity for someone to attribute anything they use to the original creator.  In the business world, unless you're talking about theory, then you're probably using your own data or analysis.  If it was me, I would have included the source either below the visual or as a footnote. </p>
>	<p>I wasn't there, but it sounds like they were trying to embellish "their" ideas, but either using or quoting work from someone else.  I could be wrong, but isn't that plagiarism?  If they didn't know the difference between treemaps and heatmaps, then that says a lot.</p>
>	<p>To answer your questions:</p>
>	<p>Yes, they should have mentioned the name/source.</p>
>	<p>Yes, *some* people in the business world remember back to our education where we were required to cite sources.</p>
>	<p>No, I would question someone's integrity when I see work copied or repeated verbatim without a mention or citation.</p>

>	<p>...but at a tangent, I wonder if anyone can help me find out about something called a "Marshey" or "Marshy" diagram or graph, or chart. Some colleagues showed me something in Excel they named as such. It was a line chart showing a time series, against a colored background area representing good, acceptable, bad, etc.  So far so good.  But there was also a line series of markers (no line) with error bars. The line was supposed to pass between the error bars of the markers, which were thus called the "gates".  So although the colored areas were judgmental, the error bars, which followed a different path, were the actual target.</p>
>	<p>I have little confidence that what I have described is a standard example of the type of chart that was named to me, as I have experience of charts and scorecards being named after some passing business fad, heavily modified over the years, but still named after the original scorecard type.  I've seen many "Balanced Scorecards" that bear no resemblance to Kaplan and Norton's original concept.</p>
>	<p>So perhaps this is relevant after all.  It's the opposite business practice: incorrectly attributing a display to some prestigious source, when the design does not adhere to that source.</p>

>	<p>You're dealing with a sales guy.  I've seen the exact same presentation, my complaint is they didn't make a point of letting you know that the moving bubble graph wasn't an out of the box function, but instead a customized widget.</p>
>	<p>I don't think that there's an issue with not giving credit to the author of the original research, because the forum that you were in wasn't meant to showcase the integrity of the data, or to take credit for the research and compilation of the data, but instead the presentation was meant to showcase the functionality of the product.  The creation of the customized flash report may have been modelled after Rosling's dashboards, it was still recreated within the Microstrategy platform.  While it would be nice to give credit where credit is due, I don't see it as an ethical lapse.</p>

>	<p>The moving bubble graph is an out of the box flash widget in MicroStrategy. Not an exclusive custom widget.</p>
>	<p> </p>
>	<p>Also, in the MicroStrategy manual/course guide about building dashboads, Stephen Few and Edward Tufte are mentioned. Other works cited: Wayne Eckerson and Gene Zelazny.</p>
>	<p>I agree to the point here: they should have mentioned Hans Rosling in the presentation. There is no weakness in using great ideas and techniques of others or following the experts ;)</p>
