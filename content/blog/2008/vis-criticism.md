# Paper on Visualization Criticism in CG&A

A paper on <a href="/blog/2006/visualization-criticism">visualization criticism</a> just appeared in the Visualization Viewpoints section of this month's <a href="http://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/cg/&amp;toc=comp/mags/cg/2008/03/mcg03toc.xml">Computer Graphics and Applications (CG&amp;A)</a>. Authors are yours truly, Fritz Drury, Lars Erik Holmquist, and David Laidlaw.

The idea behind this article was to discuss the background of vis criticism a bit, talk about practical experiences, and offer a glimpse into a possible future. David and Fritz share their experiences teaching a class of computer science and design students, where critiquing played a big role. Lars responds to <a href="/blog/2006/informative-art">my criticism</a> with a critique of critiquing. And I claim that criticism is something we're already doing (paper reviews) and need to do more to further develop the theory in our field.
