>	<p>The tree chart below the first bar chart has an unfortunate error. While this is an effective way to describe the bars in the chart, one of the [n] shapes is colored green instead of yellow, which threw off comprehension for a moment.</p>
>	<p>Not a typo, but an issue with visualization effectiveness, is the use of the colored Venn diagram as a legend for the colored bar chart. This was much more difficult to comprehend than the version with the tree.</p>

>	<p>Thanks for catching that, that's a really dumb mistake. I don't know how we missed that. It seems like this was introduced when the graph was redrawn for the magazine layout.</p>
>	<p>Patrick's colored Venn diagram neatly ties together the original idea from the paper with the sorted bars. It helps people navigate the structure who are more familiar or comfortable with the Venn diagram than a tree structure. But in terms of navigation, I agree that the tree works better.</p>
