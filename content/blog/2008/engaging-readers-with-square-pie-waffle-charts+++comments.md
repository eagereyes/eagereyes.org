At least the points in a round pie are all wedge-shaped, so the distortion is due to misjudgment of the area or angle of the wedge. In a square pie, data points are added on starting at the next point in the raster, so the shapes are not all uniformly rectangular, or wedge shaped, or circular (as in a bubble chart), so misjudgments of area are compounded by irregularity of the shapes. If the chart designer gets at all creative and arranges the shapes in any artistic tiling pattern, the misjudgments multiply: a 2x8 rectangle may seem different than an 8x2 rectangle, and both are different than a 4x4 rectangle.

The brick chart showing minutes in class also has its measurements constrained mostly in the vertical dimension. For a quick impression the relative thickness of the layers is sufficient, while the reader who wants a more detailed look isn't too badly inconvenienced by mentally integrating the partial fill of the top layer of the segment.

>	<p>Heh, my initial notes said "respond to Jon Peltier's criticism" - I've seen you post links and make statements about these charts, and I will look into those in more detail soon. And I'm not entirely disagreeing with you: that <a href="http://www.enterprise-dashboard.com/2008/05/06/the-square-pie-chart/">business graphics page</a> I linked above has one chart with a hole in the middle and a very uneven layout, for example. But there is no chart type that can't be abused. Overall though, I think that these are much better than the traditional pie charts.</p>
>	<p>As I said in my original square pie charts posting, it's probably a good idea to lay the chart out like a squarified treemap. That makes the parts as comparable as possible &ndash; perhaps not perfect, but still better and more accurate than pie charts.</p>

>	I find the first graph a little misleading.  It's apples and oranges.  One is a total, the other a total per year.  To me it would have been much more interesting if the there were two levels.  On the first level, it showed the total debt, like in above left and to the right of it, it showed the total savings of the average household.  Then below that, on the left it could show yearly payments to debt and to the right of that the savings per year as per the graph above on the right.

It's sort of like misleading statistics, nearly everybody is vulnerable to them when presented creatively and you are not paying super attention.

>	Now, as for whether I think the square charts are interesting.  Boredom, is a large barrier to learning.  Diversity of presentation is good, when applied in a thoughtful way.  So, I like them.  Of course, if square charts were the 99% norm, I would say the same for bar charts.

>	<p>True, but it's still an interesting comparison. Perhaps it would have made sense to compare the savings to the average monthly mortgage payment &ndash; which is undoubtedly at least twice the yearly savings. I also wonder how well you can project savings, I've seen a graphic somewhere showing how savings have declined over the last 30 years and how instead people have been taking on more and more debt.</p>
