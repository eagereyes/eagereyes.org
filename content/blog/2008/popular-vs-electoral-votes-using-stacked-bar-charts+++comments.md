>	<p>Thanks! But in Numbers, you can't delete single elements like bars and legend items - I tried. Excel is clearly more flexible.</p>

>	I still recommend that you sort your view by the percent of the popular vote.  You can clearly see when the electoral college helped an election get to a majority.  The sort also makes it easier to see the popular vote part of the stacked bar chart, which makes it easier to see the "amplification" of the electoral college.

>	I checked out Kelly's chart, and while it's a good attempt, I prefer Robert's stacked bar chart. To me, the stacked bar chart shows more clearly the three elections with the reversed electoral to popular vote tallies.

>	While the dot plot improves the data to ink ratio, I feel that this ratio is overvalued as a measure of the quality of a chart. If there were a single series in the chart, the dot plot would be better. The dot plot fails to distinguish the two series, however, while the stacked bar chart shows them clearly.

>	Robert - thanks for your comments on my dot plot alternative.

>	I revised my original dot plot to sort by electoral votes and I've replaced the dots with lines. The dot plot now shows the results much more clearly. Does it match up to your bar chart now?

>	I too felt the bars were fine, except that the intense vibrating colours made it hard for me to see where the switch-arounds were. So I commented on Kelly's blog with a floating bar alternative, and have now compromised with a <a href="http://i-ocean.blogspot.com/2008/10/using-colour-for-preattentive.html">stacked bar version</a> on my own blog, very like Robert's original, except that the lower bars are much lighter in colour.

>	I like "data:ink ratio" as a rough guide, but it's clearly more suited to the days when ink actually could be used as a proxy for "draftsman's expensive time". In our computer age, a complicated image is as cheap to make as a simple one, and it's the readers' attention that is at a premium. How to update data:ink for the modern day? I like the idea that what counts is edges.
