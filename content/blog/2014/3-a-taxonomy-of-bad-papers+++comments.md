>	Excellent post! This really sums up all the major failings of vendor-sponsored white papers too. The difference is that instead of having an academic paper rejected by a peer review, with a white paper you turn off all the prospects that you might have engaged. I've re-Tweeted and posted this post to my community of white paper writers. Great job!

It would be interesting if people were willing to (anonymously) submit their trainwrecks somewhere, but I'm not sure that would work. A good way to get a sense of bad papers is to review for some conferences, though.
