>	In discussions of CEO pay we often hear that they make X times what their workers are paid. While your chart does illustrate this, I think it lacks the impact of the one-hour chart. The comparison using different units is strength of that chart and not a weakness -- seeing that it takes days, weeks, MONTHS to match a single CEO hour highlights the disparity very effectively in my opinion.

>	I woud love to somehow link this data to the societal impact and value of the jobs they get paid for... It's also interesting that some well-off countries like Austria seem to have less worker-ceo-pay-difference than neighbouring and comparable Germany or Switzerland. Could perhaps be interesting to factor in the size of businesses (perhaps more small and medium businesses are better to keep the gaps small and the society healthy than large ones) and the number of employees?!

>	Yawn.  I'm so tired of CEO-pay-bashing.  How about a chart showing the total economic impact of a CEO's workday compared to that poor hourly McDonald's worker?  Who creates more jobs, etc.?  How about some supply and demand curves showing the relative scarcity of people able to run a large company vs. those able to ask, "You want fries with that?"

>	The existence of people able to run large companies well is unknown. That is why the market pays what it does for those CEOs in question because when it is known the market has to assume it must be preserved. If it was known, we'd have a completely different labour market for CEOs (and most other white-collar jobs). A Harvard study of the effect of "revealed talent" is well worth reading here (link is PDF):
