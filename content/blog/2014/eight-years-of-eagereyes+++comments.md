>	Excellent post Robert and congratulations on 8 years of invaluable service for the field. At some point when I get time I'm working on a post about some of the issues you've raised there about things we do know, things we don't know: the blurred lines that are both the failing and the attraction of the field. Here's to another 8 years!

I totally agree with you on the topic and more than ofter people say that they have been doing things the same way for years and dont like the change. If one does not understand and find ways that they could improve, I guess they will never learn.

>	Robert, congrats. Eight years qualify you as one of the tribe's wise men.

>	I strongly disagree with you regarding that supposed "religious zealotry". Most of the time it's just crystal-clear laziness (you have to have an opinion and echoing arguments against pie charts is easy). Some people see it as a rite of passage: I hate pie charts, so I'm not a boy/girl (datavis-wise) anymore. By the way, "the only worse design than a pie chart is several of them" but what if we call them "small multiples"?

We can't blame people for using pie charts and are unable to offer them a better option within their (limited) design skills, the tools they can use and the processes they have no control of.
