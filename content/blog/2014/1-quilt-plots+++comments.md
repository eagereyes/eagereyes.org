In addition, “quilt plots” have several advantages over “heat maps”. Firstly, unlike “heat maps”, “quilt plots” come with easily understood R-functions (i.e. plot, legend and color). In addition, R is freely available software and supported by leading statistical experts around the world, and it is important to promote the use of this software among epidemiological researchers. In addition it is difficult to learn to use R compared to other statistical packages. For example, “heat maps” require the specification of 21 arguments including hierarchical clustering, weights for re-ordering the row and columns dendrogram, which are not always easily understood unless one has an extensive programming knowledge and skills. One of the aims of our paper is to present “quilt plots” as a useful tool with simply formulated R-functions that can be easily understood by researchers from different scientific backgrounds without high-level programming skills.

This will potentially increase the visibility and awareness of these types of useful statistical tools and graphical presentations.

>	So they're basically saying that there is nothing in the paper to warrant publication. And as I've pointed out above, the claim about making this accessible is completely moot if they provide their code as pictures! This is worse than a hoax, because it doesn't even try to mislead the reviewers; it says quite clearly: "please reject, there's nothing new here!"
