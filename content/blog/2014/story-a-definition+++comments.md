Fan-fiction comes to mind as an example of exploration spurred by an already articulated story. What I see in many story maps is a tendency to just put thematically related, but disjointed pieces of data and information on a map with the expectation that the viewer finds the (a?) story. That stories are implied and discoverable apparently means that there’s no need for the story maps author to actually write the story that prompted them to make the map in the first place! This, to me, is a frustrating mindset to deal with when, regarding stories, we’re talking about something that is really central to human civilization and culture.
