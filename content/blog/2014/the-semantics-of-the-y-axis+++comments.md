And how can "downhill" and "uphill" both be negative? "It's all downhill from here" vs an "uphill struggle". What about "messed up" and "hold up"? Any more? What about positive "down" terms?

>	Well, it's not that simple. Not every use of "up" has that sort of meaning, "breaking up" and "messed up" are clearly examples of that. Your "uphill battle" example is wrong, though: what's negative about it is that it's hard to fight when you're also moving up a hill (think carrying heavy weapons up a hill), while the enemy can throw and roll things down at you. This isn't purely metaphorical, this comes from actual use in the past. There is some context here beyond just the direction.
