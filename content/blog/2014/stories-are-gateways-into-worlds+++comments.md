>	Great thoughts and I'm with you here. There's definitely room for both. I think basically the "stories" meme is a buzzy way to decribe one aspect of the applications of data visualization. I see them as a) Knowledge Transfer focused visualization (static infographics, pre-rendered animation, videos — stories) and b) Data Exploration focused applications (interactive tools, software — worlds). And of course there's overlap between the both like the gapminder examples (which is good :)).

>	Robert, I agree as well, you need something like a story to kickstart attention.and exploration. With our new e-atlas concept www.tellmaps.com we try to offer a publishing template to do just that (not everyone has a charismatic presenter at hand..). Narrative content and visual data exploration in one interface.

>	Moritz has such a poor idea of what a story is: "consumers, who just passively listen to all the exiting stories", "pre-digested narrative with a surprise at the end", and this: “'tell a story' — whatever that means, anyways), carries the risk to throw us back into linear, author-driven, leanback media formats (think 'TV')".

>	I find Moritz' article brilliant and in a way necessary, it's just that I don't see any dichotomy on it, stories and worlds are two words for the same thing (as Robert also seems to suggest), both being as non-linear and complex as the author's skills and will can produce. I haven't seen any interactive explorative data visualization that is more complex, deep, brain demanding or non-linear as a good novel.
