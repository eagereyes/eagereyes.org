>	Ah, yes! I had seen it before, but forgotten where it was. I may have built newsvis after hers unconsciously. Marije's site is limited to just The New York Times and The Guardian though, and also includes some less data-based graphics; her filters are much sleeker, though.

>	I think it would be perfect to merge the databases. Could get you in contact with Marije if you are interested at all.

>	Yes, can you email me? Merging the databases might be a challenge (different categories, etc.), but it's worth exploring.

>	Absolutely love it! You are definitely not the only one finding beautiful visualisations in the local newspaper during holiday. Now we never have to miss a fantastic infographic ever again.
>	Also love that you subdivide the chart categories. This calls for a weekly curated top three, or so.

>	Love it! All those visualizations just speak to me and I can get why they need to be so different. Great :)
