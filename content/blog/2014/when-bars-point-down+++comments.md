The large peak around 2006-7 and the semi-reguilar variation month-by-month give it such a strong physical analog that you can be diverted from remembering these detailed data about real individuals. And because the greatest peak at the start of 2003 doesn't quite behave in the way we might expect blood dripping from the top to behave, in part it becomes marginalised (literally and metaphorically). It's an interesting design choice to think about not just what metaphors support the interpretation and impact of graphical depiction, but how strongly the metaphor should shape its interpretation.

In some ways, this doesn't follow good practice in that I wasn't showing positive and negative divergence from a baseline, but rather simply magnitude (rider frequency). Yet I found anchoring the bars at their centre point rather than a top or bottom baseline was more effective in showing the structural changes in frequency. While obviously driven by the metaphor of sound waves in an oscilloscope type view, I found the 'double encoding' of magnitude both upward and downward lent itself more readily to assessing the macrostructure of clustering and spread of riders. I am not aware of any empirical work on the perception of magnitudes with different common baseline anchors, but it might be an interesting aspect of design to investigate further.
