>	Great Thought, Robert. You rightly pointed out the fact "Where there are more people..more crimes".  And ultimately "maps show underlying distribution of people".

And then there's the question of whether this should be adjusted by the local cost of living.  $100,000 in Manhattan NY doesn't go as far as it does in Manhattan, Kansas.

>	My favorite example of this has always been NICB's yearly list of most stolen cars. Not surprisingly, the Honda Civic is usually on top of the list - because it's the most commonly sold car! One year they released data normalized by the number of cars sold, although I see the current report omits that information again. In the normalized data, the Saturn was on the top of the list. Perhaps that explains why my Saturn was stolen three times!

>	Love it Robert. We try to stress this here at the office as I work for a global company, however, if I use the raw numbers it typically shows us where our corporate HQ is, something most of the company should already know.
