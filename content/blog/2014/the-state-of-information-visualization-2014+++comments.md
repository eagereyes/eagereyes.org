>	Another key trend in scientific visualization that is rapidly emerging is Ensemble Visualization. Scientists create ensembles in computational modeling by by executing a simulation repeatedly but with slightly different input parameters and storing the results into a portfolio (or ensemble).  Scientists compare the results via scientific or statistical visualization methods.

>	Hi Robert, thanks for the thoughtful and in-depth post. Just a point of clarification here, the Visualized conference you mentioned actually first took place in November 2012 (http://visualized.com/2012/), where the focus was also storytelling with data visualization, and the speakers were called "storytellers" back then as well. Just an FYI... that given the dates, some of what you suggested above is factually incorrect. But more importantly there was a lot of people talking about this before you and I, and I think we're all proponents of the same thing so who was first etc, really shouldn't be a huge deal :)  Either way, great post! thank you.

>	Thanks for pointing that out, I've edited that paragraph. I thought that the speakers being called storytellers at Visualized was a new thing for some reason. I didn't mean to suggest that we invented the term or the idea of a storytelling conference, I guess I got a bit too excited there. ;)

>	Robert, a great summary of 2013! I also wrote about the US Gun Deaths Interactive visualisation on my website: http://www.vizworld.com/2013/09/gun-deaths-infographics-emotional-storytelling/ . It has since gone on to win a Bronze prize from the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards.

The Internet of Things will massively impact data visualization as a field, as the non-data scientist will desire and learn to read these data streams in easily digestible infographics, as much as Edward Tufte talks about reading the statistics of sports teams through visuals is a given by every sports fan.
