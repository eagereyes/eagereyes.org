What's to stop me thinking all 3D pie charts are OK? I then have a license to mislead, and before you know it, I've turned into David McCandless.

>	Hey, I like playing the skeptical free-thinker as much as the next person, but all knee-jerk reactions aside, this really is a terrible chart. Virtually every piece of information that can be gleaned from it is more difficult than it needs to be. For example, the only way I can tell that the "white collar" and "manufacturing" blocks are higher than the "sales" block (rather than being, say, irregularly spaced) is by focusing on the very front or back ends of the blocks--in other words, by focusing on the 2D aspects of the blocks. The "percentage of workforce" information, like so many stacked bar charts, gives only the roughest indication of the the relative percentages even at a single time point, and I cannot even *begin* to tell what is happening with those percentages over time--I literally have to just read the numbers. For any one particular block, the change in average earnings over time is fairly readable, although again mainly by actively suppressing the 3D aspects of the plot and just focusing on the side of the block. But as for comparing the four average-earnings time series to one another... forget about it. I can see that the "white collar" and "manufacturing" time series tend to have a similar shape, but that's about it.

As for getting the job done, it does so in the sense that it tries to show many things at once and does basically not a great job showing any but the most obvious patterns. If actually conveying the data are of any interest, I think it would be well worth sacrificing the "cohesion" of this unitary 3D chart by just using multiple, simple panels. I do appreciate the devil's-advocate intention of this post, but in my mind this example does nothing but confirm the common rule of thumb and exemplify some of the most frequently cited problems.

>	Robert I agree with your position that this charting approach has value. When teaching BI I provide guidelines to avoid the overhead of 3D charts if they do not provide additional value. Typically they do not, but context does play a role. A colleague built a similar chart to this a couple of months ago. The chart defined average lifespan for various countries over time. I learned from the visualization that it varies of time, likely driven by government polices. This type of chart provides a good macro view of the data concurrently. It is difficult to provide this macro view with multiple related series in 2D. Using 2D makes the audience perform all kinds of cognitive storage, comparison, and gymnastics to mentally see what is going on with the entire data set. The pinpoint objective can also be accomplished with the same 3D configuration by clicking on an individual year that would highlight the single measurement in each series across the buildups. The entire visualization can also be rotated to give the 2D comparison of the single year measurement.

Your WIRED example also reminds me of a similar critique-worthy 3D chart featured in a GOOD magazine Transparency from 2009: http://magazine.good.is/infographics/transparency-where-are-all-the-fish

Fighting knee-jerk reactions requires some sense of self-awareness, an ability to slow down and reflect before crafting a response, and then consider how that response will be delivered and received. Unfortunately, in many online sharing platforms, the invitation to participate and "share" seems more compelling than the need to apply thoughtful consideration to what is being shared.

I can't tell very well when they did what, because the scale to tell me that is distorted from the direction of the changes over time, and they all appear more or less flat over the full time span to me...
