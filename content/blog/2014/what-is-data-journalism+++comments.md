I wonder though at which point we enter "data journalism" territory. This sample (less than 80 cartridges) seems quite small and inconclusive, as the author repeats several times. The analysis is barely numerical. Is it the size of the data set what will make an article "data journalism"? Is it the analytical methods applied to any data set?

The scientific journals already exist and they are read by a tiny audience, require massive resources, and often produce arcane findings. It seems to me that we need to be more lenient with journalism, not to expect the highest standards of data and statistical analysis.
