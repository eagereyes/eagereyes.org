I happen to have been interested in Napoleonic history and thus read e.g. the memoirs of A. de Caulaincourt [basically Napoleon's ministry of exterior], published in various editions, the one I have is from ~1933 (Plon Eds., France). The numbers being given there are definitely different than what Minard shows. Also, there are many pointers in history literature indicating that sizeable contingents left Russia and returned to Poland during the campaign / moved North with Bernadotte and others. Even worse, Minard got his data from Thiers, de Ségur, de Fezensac, and de Chambray. Thiers and de Fezensac and de Chambray are, if anything, _not_ people who would have wished to report correct facts about Napoleon [a simple history check shows their credentials]. The annotation of 10K soldiers leaving Russia (end of thin black line) is a complete fake - even Russian sources of that time, let alone official records (Le Moniteur), and many other historians (e.g. Castelot) all list around 23K-30K soldiers returning.
