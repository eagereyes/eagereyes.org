In my opinion the most successful format for complex data visualization is scrollytelling. This allows you to move forward, backward and delve into each and every part. The problem with video is the difficulty in moving back and forth and managing viewing speed. I can read the articles at my own pace, I must watch the video at the pace of the creator.

>	Hi Robert. Thanks for a great, thought-provoking post.
>	
>	It's very interesting for me because I decided recently to write about data vis, presenting and similar topics. I questioned whether blogging was the right medium because I kept stumbling upon podcasts, or practitioners using YouTube.
>	
>	I think there's a place for writing about data vis. I've learned a huge amount from reading your posts, books by Alberto Cairo and others, Lisa C Rost's blog and so on. My early posts will be 'thought pieces', describing concepts and ways to think about data vis. There will be some images but enough to justify making a video? I don't know. It would mostly be me talking to camera (or static images).

>	YouTube is great for walk-throughs that teach a skill so you can follow the steps. I may do some. It's worth noting that content like that can get bundled into courses delivered somewhere else, e.g. SkillShare. However they're shared I'm with you; sometimes they're the best way.
>	
>	Podcasting and ClubHouse are the intriguing choices. Tackling data vis with no visuals seems like an odd choice. But they can be strangely engaging. Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic's podcast is great in how she brings others into the discussion and makes any visuals available as a complement to the show. I listen to them while running (not so easy to do with videos).
>	
>	There's lots of content around now so it's interesting to see how it's being done.

>	So why is this post not a video, then? :-)
>	I'd create a video to accompany every blog post that I write but, as you point out, it's hideously time-consuming to make something that's actually worth watching (it takes me at least three to five full days of work for a three- to fifteen-minute video). While video is almost always more effective (and not just for data viz...), sometimes it adds a lot more value than others, depending on the specific topic. My rule is that, if a video will make a big difference for the topic at hand, I'll create one, but if it's a topic for which a video wouldn't add as much value, I'll leave it as a textual blog post to be able to devote the saved time to other projects.

>	Aha, but I did not say everything has to be a video ;) Quite the opposite actually, I think it's important to choose the right medium for the topic and material you have. Some things work better as written text, like my posting here. There aren't a lot of visuals to illustrate my points. But in other cases, like when discussing visualizations, there are (or should be)

nickdesb says…
>	Good point, although the question then becomes when text is more effective than even just a talking head saying basically the same thing with no visuals (if none are needed, although even just some slides with a few bullets are often more effective than just a talking head with no visuals). The main advantages I see with text are that it's usually faster to consume and it offers better "random access" to refer back to something that was encountered earlier on in the piece. Apart from that, it's usually less engaging and requires more cognitive effort to consume than video because the audience has to "decode" text into spoken language in order to understand it (i.e., why kids often move their lips when they read). I suspect that this is probably why podcasts, YouTube, audiobooks, etc.are so popular now, and print media tends to be becoming less popular (for better or for worse).

<a href="/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Kosara</a> says…
>	I think it comes down to editing more than talking/video vs. text. Text is almost always at least read over once, but a lot of really pointless videos are just unstructured talking. I can't stand those, and I also don't listen to podcasts that aren't reasonably well structured. They just feel like a waste of time.
>	
>	So I think the difference isn't just that video needs to have a reason, like good visuals (not just slides with talking points that add no value), but that it needs to be scripted and edited. Text is sort of edited by default, and video needs to be considered and edited too to be worth it.

nickdesb says…
>	Ah, but the question has now changed from "When does text tend to be more effective than video?" to "Does text tend to be more carefully crafted than video?" :-) That's a different question to which I'd have a different answer (which would be similar to yours).
>	
>	Yes, a poorly structured video is going to be less effective than a well-structured piece of text. The more interesting comparison is between a well-crafted video and well-written piece of text...

>	I'm going to politely disagree with the terms "scripting" and "editing."
>	
>	By "scripting," I think you mean that vides should be well-planned. Just turning on the recorder and word-vomiting is a big waste of our audience's time. But.... most of us will sound more natural *without* a script vs. with a script. I like to plan in bullet-point format, but then just speak naturally off those bullet points, but not from a word-for-word script.
>	
>	By "editing," I think you mean that videos should look and sound professional. But I'd argue that you don't need any editing skills at all, and you don't need to hire someone else to edit either. You can make outstanding one-take videos.
>	
>	Here's a recent example, which was planned but NOT scripted, and professional (I think? ha) but with zero editing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCgFntGjglo&amp;feature=emb_title

<a href="/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Kosara</a> says…
>	I certainly agree that scripting doesn't have to mean word for word. I tend to end up writing full sentences when I'm really thinking through something, but bullet points can totally work. But it's scripting either way as opposed to the word-vomiting you mention ;)
>	
>	I do think editing is important unless you're really good at sticking to your script and don't go off on side rants like *some of us* are prone to. Editing is actually pretty easy if your recording is decent, I don't think you should have to pay somebody else to do it.
>	
>	The video you link to is clearly well scripted (in the bullet-point sense), you have prepared slides, and it seems like you've given that talk before. So maybe rehearsing is a possible alternative to scripting too. And it depends on your style and delivery of course, some people can pull it off, others not without extensive editing.

<a href="/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Kosara</a> says…
>	True, but I think the two questions are quite strongly intertwined. But there's also the "is it worth it?" question, and there I just think that a short piece of text (think a tweet or short blog post) is going to be much better bang for buck (storage, effort, clicks, time to consume, annoyance if it wasn't worth it, etc.) than video in general.

<a href="/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Kosara</a> says…
>	Oh, and to your other point: if you're comparing high-quality video and writing, video is still probably quite a bit more effort. But if it's done well and you're going to show a lot of visuals anyway, the video will be worth it.
