>	Hi Robert! Very interesting post, and thank you for sharing. I very much agree that we should go back to our basic assumptions about dataviz and re-evaluate them from time to time. Indeed, I frequently do that in my field of research (machine learning) and find that many of the rules of thumb in machine learning don't hold for modern methods.
>	
>	Anyway, the main point I wanted to raise here is that although we should definitely take a research-oriented approach to re-evaluating our basic assumptions in dataviz, we should not take one research study as gospel. In research studies, it's possible for the experimental design to be flawed in some way, or the results to be interpreted improperly, or even just to have a "bad batch" of test subjects that affect the outcome when there's a small sample size.
>	
>	For that reason, I think we should hold out on drawing conclusions such as, "3D Bar Charts Considered Not That Harmful" until we see *several* research studies corroborating that result. And, if we read the research article you linked, there are in fact research studies showing the opposite finding wrt the effect of 3D.

>	Great post. Most data vis rules seem focused on the idea that precision is the Most Important Thing. I want to explore using less precise charts and marks for less precise data.

>	Nice post Robert. I agree that it's too easy to slam a 3D chart or pie chart or whatever else Tufte slams. It's also fun. But I don't think you can defend the Trivapro chart with "There is no confusion here about which bar is longer." Fair enough, if the data are sound then the chart doesn't *lie*, it's not *that* bad. But the whole point of producing the chart this way was presumably to make exactly that point — that the red bar is longer — and indeed to exaggerate it with the nonlinear, cut-off, and/or bent axis. You could say the same about many junky charts: they set out to reduce confusion. That sounds fine in principle, but they go too far the other way and now the confusion works in their favour.

>	So, what I am getting here is, "yes, it's a really bad chart, that's really easy to make better, but some people make bad charts that aren't 3D too.  Oh yeah, and screw Tuft."
>	
>	While there are obviously people who will take Tuft's views as a dictionary to define what you can and can't do, and feel smug in doing so, the very real and valid criticisms of this absurd chart are plenty, and the fact that you can make a bad chart in 2D has no bearing on that whatsoever.
>	
>	I also think it's about time we stop using the "Oh, you just say that because Tuft!" argument every time some criticizes a shitty data visualization.
>	
>	I agree that it's a great idea to examine our presumptions about charts. That about ends what I can agree with in this post :)

>	Hi Robert, 
>	Interesting post you've got here, and I understand what you're trying to say. Essentially, not every chart that strays from the standards espoused by 'purists' warrants breaking out the pitchforks and torches. I agree with that. 
>	
>	What I don't agree with is that a chart being "Less Bad" makes it in any way good, or acceptable for its intended purpose. Not that you stated that explicitly, but it's implied by the title of your post.
>	
>	Now this is where it gets tricky because the intended purpose is so massively influential in the matter. Specifically, if the purpose is to be marketing collateral, then viewers should treat it as such. And if an Executive report, then I would hope this sort of thing would never make it to that audience.

>	However, the danger of thinking that this type of design can be "ok" is that it is exposed to several people of varying degrees of responsibility in business. And where someone reads a post like this, and takes it as an endorsement of this type of design, it becomes harmful. To what degree? I can't say, but it certainly is not helpful towards the aim of fostering a set of visualization best practices.
