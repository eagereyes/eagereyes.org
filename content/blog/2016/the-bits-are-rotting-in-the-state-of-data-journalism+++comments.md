>	As interactive data graphics designer for The BMJ (formerly The British Medical Journal), this is something that plagues me all the time. It's a particularly acute problem for scientific journals, as the things we publish become part of the scientific record, and losing them is perhaps even more painful. I don't have any good answers to the problem, but you are right on the money with this.

>	I wonder how prudent it would be to make everything static after a set amount of time as shared resources start evolving.  Perhaps after a period of six months and strong traffic dies down to a particular visualization, all linked content (css, javascript, data, etc.) are archived alongside the visualization.  Maybe wedge this process into the retention policy workflow?

>	It's certainly an interesting issue. My partner is a librarian, so she deals a lot with cataloguing and archiving, and she runs across "bit rot" constantly. It's frustrating for her day-to-day, but also quite sad, knowing that so much information is so ephemeral these days.
