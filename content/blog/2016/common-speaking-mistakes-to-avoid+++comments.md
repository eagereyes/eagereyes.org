>	Using words to explain where to look in a visualization is much better, but surprisingly common is a speaker who, when wishing to point out something on the left of an image, will turn back to the screen pause a moment and then say "on the left as you are looking at it". If it's on the left on your laptop, it's on the left on the big screen and on the left in the minds of the audience. No mirror transformations required.

>	I know someone wise once said that during a presentation you should 1. Say what you are going to say; 2. Say it; 3. Say what you just said. But I find it a waste of valuable presentation time when slide number two is "Structure of my talk: 1. Introduction; 2. Methods; 3. Results; 4. Conclusions". We kinda guessed it was going to follow this structure and will probably manage without the heads-up.

>	Good points! I didn't even want to go into the structure of the talk, just simple speaking things. I have a feeling there will be a follow-up posting or two.

>	A presentation (mistake) I notice frequently is explaining step by step how one's presentation came together — the presentation about the presentation. I understand that it may have been a major drama in your life as a presenter that you were asked to present, that you faced something on the level of an existential crisis while developing the talk, but unless you were asked to teach us how to do research and prepare talks just give us the final product!

>	Here's another one: the presenter constantly looks at his/her Powerpoint and/or reads it verbatim. The goal of having a visual aid is NOT to look at it the entire time, but instead to support or complement what you're trying to explain. It's also a tool to improve the presentation and make it more interesting, not an excuse to disengage with the audience. You should look at people and talk to them.

>	When it comes to presenting papers, I have often seen people trying to put everything in the presentation. This results in speaker copying entire table of results in the slide. Generally, text and numbers cannot be read and more importantly, audience has no idea what exactly to look at in the table. I always find it more useful when important results are presented by just showing a snapshot of the table or highlighting the said result in the table.

Helena says…
>	Great and I agree with most comments - same impression. Add: do face the audience at all times! (minor point: why do you use the picture of a WOMEN for a terrible talk!!??)

Iain says…
>	My bugbear is when each person in the Q&amp;A after the talk says something like "That was a great presentation" and THEN proceeds to ask the question.  Just ask your question.
