>	Is absolute error correctly described as "precision"? I normally see precision used to describe the inverse of variance---how close are people's estimates, accounting for bias. I don't think that's the same thing as the absolute error, which will include the effect of bias and variance together.

>	Interesting point. I chose precision there as a way to give people an idea what the absolute error meant. I guess the correct way of doing this would be to account for the per-person, per-chart-type bias and do the absolute difference from that. I'll have to look into this a bit.

>	Why do a square pie with irregular slices like that? Why not an even horizontal split, making it easier to quantify and making it essentially the same as a 'square bar', so a bar with a very clear large surface to analyse? I don't see the point of this square pie...? (although I do kind of see the point if there's a clear 10x10 grid as in the linked article)
