A more fair comparison would be against taxonomies from math and computer sciences, which mainly categorize known methods and compare them according to some criteria.

>	Sure, vis/hci taxonomies should strive to be operational but giving vis grammars as examples of useful taxonomies is misleading.  I’m sure, e.g., Wilkinson would be the first to say that his grammar of graphics isn’t a taxonomy, pure or impure (you could actually walk down the hallway and ask him ;))
