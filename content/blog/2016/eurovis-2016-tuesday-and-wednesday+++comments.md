>	&gt; Comparing Bar Chart Authoring with Microsoft Excel and Tangible Tiles by Tiffany Wun, Jennifer Payne, Samuel Huron, and Sheelagh Carpendale had people create and modify bar charts either in Excel or using little physical tiles. They found some interesting differences, like the fact that it’s faster to create charts in Excel than with tiles, but modifying them takes longer. The comparison clearly has its limits, but their aim is to look for hybrid models of interacting with visualizations.
