I won't ever have tenure at the lovely little private nursing college where I teach - they don't offer it. But I say I have tenure because I'm the only stats teacher ;)!

I will paraphrase - be very strong, clear, and public about your opinion of the topic. Be forceful with your evidence and your facts. Write this in a blog, and it can even be rehashes of some of your academic writing to make it accessible to wider audiences. But be kind and empathetic to your detractors. Realize that they are more likely to listen if you make it clear you understand their points-of-view but don't agree. Sound and fury about injustice or things that are just plain wrong to you is so welcome in academia. It's called activism. But there is no place for bullying, impoliteness, and a lack of grace in dealing with those who are just as passionate and professional but do not share your opinion.
