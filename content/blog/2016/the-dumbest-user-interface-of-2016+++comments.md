>	A totally deserved award!! Those things work only half the time, too. It also goes to show how far behind we are from other countries. I am currently working in Beijing, and their chip card readers are more portable, take a few seconds, make no noise and are easy and fast. And while ApplePay is lagging behind here, most stores accept AliPay and WeChat Pay, which work the same way. I think the U.S. got all the other countries' old, annoying chip readers they wanted to get rid of so they could use the nice, fast, quiet ones. Haha.

>	Still many a non-functional card slot out there, or no slot at all.  Also a shout-out to whatever companies managed to break ApplePay with the new terminals so you can try to use ApplePay only to fail and have to use the slow slot.

>	Thank you about all these observations! You catalog them nicely. What really stood out to me were the inappropriate sounds - you describe this better than I could!

>	I am not sure why does the user need a message ' DO NOT REMOVE CARD ' blinking at you . It is terribly confusing and at times I have actually removed the card just looking at the word REMOVE .

>	Thankfully the US saw how Europe uses chip &amp; PIN, and decided to dispense with the PIN part. Because, you know, if someone goes to the effort of physically taking your card, they should get to treat themselves.

>	I feel rather sheepish to admit that I neglected to notice the "swipe" and "do not use" decor has been removed at various retailers.  I still haven't activated the new chip card my bank sent me.  Apparently I haven't missed much.

>	I like how in one store, I CANNOT use the chip (must swipe) with my debit card, while at another store down the street, I MUST use the chip with that same card. It could be worse - it used to be that at the latter store, in some checkout lanes you had to use the chip while in other checkout lanes you had to swipe.
