>	Thank you for doing "eagereyes" over the last 10 years.  I wanted to add this comment to indicated how helpful your Blog was to me in a time of need.  Over the last year, when I had several medical situations that placed me in hospitals or on medical leave a little longer than anticipated, eagereyes highlighted major activities at VIS and Eurovis events.  This allowed me to keep up while being very confined to medical recovery.
