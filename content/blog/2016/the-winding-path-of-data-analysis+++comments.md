Run a pilot, follow the winding path of data analysis (I like this analogy!), record your path (e.g., as an R script). Then run the final study and use the same analysis on it. This can also help in other ways: e.g., if you want to do a power analysis, your pilot gives you the data to do that, which helps you choose the sample size for the full study.

In the case where you already have the data, I think another useful approach is model averaging---follow your winding path, but acknowledge your uncertainty in choosing the correct path (model) by averaging over several paths (models) you found.

But apparently for journals like Cortex, it's no problem---just report them in a separate "post hoc" section (as long as your main question+study was interesting and well-designed). If anything, those post-hoc things are fodder you can use to preregister your next study and thus expand your CV, *whether or not* they pan out next time.
