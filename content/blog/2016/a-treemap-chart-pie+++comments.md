>	I started by trying to show different fruit sales in the US, http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/fruit-tree-nuts/trade.aspx but this got too complicated, so I did a simplified but not realistic treemap that was visually appealing to me &amp; easy enough to make in a pie (e.g. many small rectangles were not easy).
