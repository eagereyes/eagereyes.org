>	I'm surprised you didn't include 3D pie charts in your study (apparently). I've always suggested that segments further away are underestimated in value due to perspective, whereas the closer segments are overestimated. Any thoughts? I don't hate pie charts, by the way, but I favour the unadulterated ones, properly sorted, not too many segments, etc. etc.

>	Excellent presentation, I very much enjoyed it. I'm curious though whether you did any research into the amount of time it took participants to read each visualization and come up with their answer? For example, I would guess that a donut might take slightly longer to interpret than a full pie chart because you are missing the additional visual cue of the angle. If that were the case then that would mean that a donut may well be a worse choice than a pie chart.

We've been told that pie charts aren't very pre-cognitive and we have to study them a little longer to find the answers we need which, if true, is a major drawback. Based on this I'd be fascinated to see some data around the length of time it takes people to interpret different visualizations along with the scope for error.

>	Good questions! I believe we looked at time but found no statistically significant difference between pies and donuts. I'll check with Drew on that, though (the data is also available btw).
