>	First, is it interesting to disentangle the different ways of getting the information from a chart ? As you wrote : " Angle is not likely the main, and certainly not the only, way we read pie charts". So, my intuition is that the pie charts are easily readable (and common in info-graphics) because they allow to access information in different ways. As often with human, interpretation comes from the accumulation of clues, i.e. in pie charts : angle, area and arc length. Both donuts and pies give all these clues to get a good interpretation of the information (proportion).
>	As a direct consequence of this thought on thin donuts: "There is no difference between them, other than the thinnest donut being worse than the rest (we’re not sure exactly why)." The thinnest donut doesn't provide any clue on the angle nor on the area (unlike the other forms). By using thin donuts, you just remove "clue dimensions" and increase chances that the reader makes mistakes.
>	The same interpretation can be done from distorted pie charts, if the angle is conserved, other dimensions may not be consistent with the angle information, leading to error. This wouldn't have been the case if only the angle was used to get the information.

>	Honestly, I doubt that it's very effective. It was an interesting early idea, but reading it seems quite tedious, especially when the values change a lot between months. Also, it doesn't represent a part-whole relationship, so it's a different class of diagram.

One can nearly always  turn to a different form of visualization which will outperform pie-charts on readability, comprehension, accuracy, etc...

<a href="/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Kosara</a> says…
>	Why not? The point here is to go beyond the old prejudices and base decisions on data. We can't do everything in a few studies. This was focused on trying to figure out how we read them, since we don't even know that. The comparison between pies and donuts is merely coincidental.

johnmuccigrosso says…
>	Very interesting stuff. I always liked pie charts for a small number of variables (2-4). I wonder if there's a connection with (analog) clock use. We're very good at reading clock faces, so much so that some clocks (wristwatches, typically) don't even have numbers on them.

>	I guess I’m one of those unabashed pie chart bashers. Yet I read these studies with strong interest, because they have been carried out and analyzed systematically and logically. I’ve always felt that a two-segment pie (what Jorge Camoes calls a one-segment pie) is somewhat effective if used appropriately. It’s good to see a good analysis that shows how to maintain their effectiveness.
