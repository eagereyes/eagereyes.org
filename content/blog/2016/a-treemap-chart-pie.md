# A Treemap Chart Pie

After <a href="/blog/2016/ben-shneidermans-chart-pies">his recent early chart pie attempts</a>, Ben Shneiderman has now achieved the ultimate in chart pie baking: a treemap chart pie. 

In case you're wondering about the significance of this momentous achievement: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/">treemaps were Ben's idea</a>.

Just as before, I'll just let Ben explain this one. I can't top his puns, anyway.

There's actually quite a bit of pie-engineering that goes into this sort of pie to keep it from drying out.  Since the pie is round and a treemap square (or at least rectangular), I had suggested he try a Voronoi treemap – maybe a project for the future?

Ben's chart pies have pushed me to finally buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Bake-Pi-Exploration-Mathematics/dp/0465051715">Eugenia Cheng's <em>How to Bake π</em></a> (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/books/review/how-to-bake-pi-by-eugenia-cheng.html">the glowing review here</a>). It's a bit too late for VIS this year, but perhaps somebody wants to organize a visualization bake-off next year?
