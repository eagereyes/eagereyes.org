# Talk: Pie Charts – Unloved, Unstudied, and Misunderstood

I gave a talk at <a href="http://informationplusconference.com">Information+</a> earlier this year that has now been posted. It's about pie charts! And it was a fun talk, too.

The video is focused a bit too much on me at the beginning, so you'll miss a few of the early jokes. But for the most part, you'll see the (much more important) slides rather than me. This is the talk I made the materials for that I then posted in <a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2016/an-illustrated-tour-of-the-pie-chart-study-results">my pie charts study results walk-through</a>.

There were some really good talks at Information+ – I will post a selection of links to videos here in a bit.
