# Links: Scott Klein on the History of Data Journalism

The history of data journalism goes back much farther than most people assume. Long before computers or punch cards, and before even the first newspapers the way we know them today, data was being published. ProPublica's Scott Klein has been digging up a lot of interesting history.

He wrote an article for this year's Malofiej book, which he <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/infographics-in-the-time-of-cholera">also posted on the ProPublica blog</a>. You should also subscribe to his <a href="http://tinyletter.com/abovechart">email newsletter Above Chart</a>, where he goes into more fascinating examples. And finally, watch his wonderful presentation at Tapestry 2016 below.
