>	What are your thoughts on what I'll call pseudo-maps -- maps that distort actual area into reflect what they're measuring? Here's an example from 538 (bonus: it's an election map): http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo#electoral-map

But what if your goal is to see which state voted for which candidate?  What if you want to see a regional pattern in the voting? I think it's useful in those instances.
