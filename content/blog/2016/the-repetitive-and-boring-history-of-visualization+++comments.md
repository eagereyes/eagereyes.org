You can see some of his urbanism/demographics visualizations here https://www.datamaplab.com/posts/retro-data-visualization-hickmann/

>	As an aside, I think the Snow map is a good example of something that isn't made clear enough in most discussions of dataviz: the difference between using dataviz for demonstration of a phenomenon as opposed to its *discovery*.

>	In the vast and almost total majority of cases where exotic visualisation is used (like the Minard diagram or Snow map), it's demonstrating phenomena that have been arrived at by other means. But there always seems to be a kind article of faith that infoviz also *reveals* insights. I find this faith interesting and wonder to what extent it explains the success people like David McCandless who may be trading on this faith in some way.
