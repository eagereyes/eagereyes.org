>	Robert,
>	
>	This week has been a fantastic one for me because of all the articles you have written to explain your blogging history. I just wanted to send you a quick note to thank you for all the excellent insights you explained in these articles. 
>	
>	There were many points that you made that I can relate to. For example, the name of my blog (3danim8) is short for three-d animate, or three-d animations, which is what I specialized in making back in the 1980's to mid-2000's when I was doing numerical simulation work. Most people don't even know how to pronounce my site name until I tell them, but I use the name because things like this just have a way of sticking with you. Additionally, there were many points you made in yesterday's article about why you write the blog. Many of those insights made perfect sense to me and I share your motivations. 
>	
>	The real message I want to send you is this: Even though I am not a pure data vis guy, I can't stop reading your work. Although I don't know most of the people you talk about and I'm not as academically oriented as you are with respect to data vis, there is something about the way that you write this blog that keeps me coming back. 
>	
>	It is hard to explain, but maybe it is the excellent writing, or maybe it is the cutting-edge you sometimes have, or maybe it is a combination of all the great things you do. Whatever the reason, I just wanted to say thanks for all the effort you go through to create this wonderful resource. 
>	
>	I can tell you that every time a new posting notice from eagereyes hits my inbox, I click on it to see what you have to say. Considering my time constraints, what that tells me is that what you are doing is working. You've got me at 100%.  Congratulations, and I'm looking forward to see what you do over the next 10 years.

>	Your work is much appreciated,
