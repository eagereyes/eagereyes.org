When it works there is a *huge* advantage to hands and vision free interaction and I suspect that as we move to always on and wearable devices with no screens (watches, embedded systems, wearables, Amazon Echo, etc.) we'll be increasingly reliant on bots.

They will consistently ignore all the boring old academic stuff that Robert is talking about. The people who would use such systems seem to be as highly tolerant of poor experiences as those who design them as well. This is, sadly, the reality we are failing (collectively) to deal with I think.

gilgongo says…
>	On your point 1: That's a moot point isn't it? If everything needs a syntax, then replacing one syntax with another isn't the issue, it's whether it's any better for the tasks at hand that counts.

>	On point 2: You're going to be hard-pressed to convince anyone that they're going to use something they don't know is there. Given a sufficient level of complexity in a system under use, there is of course an argument for visual simplification, but if you observe people who use complex systems, complexity per se doesn't rank very highly in their problems list. Have you seen Facebook recently? They don't do anything in the UI that doesn't pass stringent usage metric multivariate tests. The result? Show everything. Facebook users are happy. They're not attempting to solve a UI complexity problem with their bot experiments.

>	On point 3: You seem to be implying voice control. If so, then that's a bit of a different issue if there is no opportunity for direct manipulation at all.

Anthony says…
