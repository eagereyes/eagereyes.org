>	Robert, you’re assuming that everyone’s goal is to maximize the number of people reading and citing their work. Some may want the opposite - to keep their work pure and untouched by the menacingly literate. Many who submit their work to EuroVis clearly prefer their work to be obscure and unknown. Like a music group who exclusively releases on 8-track. Or a restaurant with no sign out front. Just think of them as academic hipsters. They did some research, but you’ve probably never heard of it.

>	Hey Robert, thanks so much for writing this post. I fully agree with you. Here is the thing: we are still living with this terrible legacy by which we are rewarded by publishing as a checkmark activity. Do you have another paper in the top conference. Yay!!! Work done. Let's celebrate! How do I know this? I know it because I do it. And I have been doing this for a decade now. But it does not take much to understand how absurd this is: what the heck do we celebrate publication?! Publication is not an end, it's a start! This is the kind of new mindset we need to develop. If you see publication as a starting point, then all you write makes sense. That said, it is also true many of us are still judged by these standards, at least in part. Especially, people who are on the market and are looking for an academic job just cannot afford not having the "right" number of publications in the "right" places. But it's also true that publicizing your work does not prevent doing the work itself, it's a win-win.
