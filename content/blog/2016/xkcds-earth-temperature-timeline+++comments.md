>	Thank you so much for this! I cannot believe my good luck. It is 2:40 am EST and I'm currently reviewing my son's paper on the topic of ..... Global Warming!  Da Da!  You have helped me more than you can imagine. What an amazing piece of science and art, wrapped up in a visual masterpiece. I love it.
