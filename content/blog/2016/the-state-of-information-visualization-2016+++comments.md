>	Thanks for the mention of Brunel; like you, we also lament the loss of Many Eyes, but we did want to clarify a couple of points. Most importantly is that despite having some people in common, Brunel is completely separate from RAVE — it’s a 100% Open Source tool for making D3 easier to use by people who love data, but don’t want to spend time tweaking D3 code. Basically it’s a language that generates D3 code, which you can then use any way you want (including ignoring Brunel and just using the generated JavaScript). So it’s not a D3 alternative — it’s a D3 enhancer! It may end up in IBM products, but right now it’s being used by online bloggers and most heavily in notebooks like Jupyter (iPython).  http://brunelvis.org/index.php/brunel/ is the “About Brunel” page that fills in the details.

>	Completely agree with the emphasis on Storytelling — it has been in the top 3 most talked about topics for the last 3 years and needs more core vis research focus. Exciting times indeed!
