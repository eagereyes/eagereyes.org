>	Hi Robert:
>	
>	Just to help you with reporting on a few items:
>	
>	In the 4:15 PM VAST Machine Learning papers session it was standing room only. The VAST Best paper on An Analysis of Machine and Human Analytics in Classification by Tam, Kothari, and Chen was well received. 
>	
>	In the 4:15 PM SciVis Topology-based Techniques session, the SciVis best paper on Jacobi Fiber Surfaces of Bivariate Reeb Space Computation by Tierny and Carr was presented and well received.
>	
>	The VIS Arts Program included abstract 2D and 3D compositions by Mark Stock: http://markjstock.org
>	
>	In VizLies: There was an interesting set of geographic maps shown where the titles did not match the data and the data did not match the concept being mapped.  It was amazing how incorrect the visualizations were. Ken Moreland and Bernice Rogowitz both showed awesome VisLies examples with Ken's being humorous while Bernice's were very instructional on what not to do.
>	
>	The posters and exhibit displays at IEEE VIS 2016 are impressive. 
>	
>	Looking forward to Wednesday's CG&amp;A 10:30 AM Session on Visualization Systems &amp; Applications papers that were previously published during the 2015/2016 year in CG&amp;A. 
>	
>	A Major Wednesday highlight is also the SciVis Contest session, at 2 PM, that presents the winner, honorable mentions and entries of the 2016 contests.
>	
>	And then there is the banquet on Wednesday evening.

>	Thank you for mentioning our group's work on Vega-Lite!
>	
>	In case readers are interested, I thought I'd briefly highlight the specific research contributions of the work: extending grammar-based visualization specification to support *interactive, multi-view displays*.
>	
>	In addition to the individual, static plots common to existing tools, we propose ways to concisely generate multi-view displays (from trellis plots and scatter plot matrices to arbitrary layers and dashboards) and, most importantly, to author interaction techniques (panning, zooming, brushing &amp; linking, and so on) -- all within a declarative and compositional framework that supports custom design rather than cookie-cutter templates.
>	
>	The current version of Vega-Lite available online does not yet include these interactive extensions, but we're hard at work developing a release fit for public consumption. We hope to have this out within the next few months! (http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/vega-lite/)

>	Thanks for mentioning our work Robert. 
>	
>	The idea of stacking data points to convey an interest in a bar chart stems from a study conducted by INNOVIS lab (directed by Sheelagh Carpendale) to understand how people create visualizations using only tangible building blocks. They showed that majority of participants stacked data points in the shape of bars to count the number of specific items. 
>	
>	We are currently working on expanding this idea to other visualization techniques (e.g., line charts), analytical tasks (e.g.,aggregating), and domains data visualization (e.g., interaction by demonstration).
