>	No-one interacts with steppers. No-one. Now that we've got that out of the way... as a scroller enthusiast who occasionally shares some of your concerns, let me address each point:
>	
>	1) Yes, it would be better if the scrolling gave immediate and direct feedback, but there's nothing fundamentally wrong with mixing discrete and continuous. Paragraphs are discrete, but no-one suggests we should step through paragraphs. Scrolling is the more natural interaction. (No-one interacts with steppers.)
>	
>	2) A stepper doesn't give you any better indication of how long it will take you to get through it. It just tells you how many steps there are, which isn't the same thing.
>	
>	3) Why? Being able to go to point 3 is meaningless except for the fact that it's between 2 and 4. The progression through the narrative is the entire point.
>	
>	4) Agreed. A scrolling action should present immediate and direct feedback, without jank.
>	
>	5) Basically the same as 4. Agreed. It's an execution problem, not a fundamental problem with scroll-driven storytelling.
>	
>	6) One of the nice things about scrolling is that you can achieve that level of precision.
>	
>	7) Easily solved by enabling the user to pause and restart without watching all the way through. Definitely not a fundamental problem with scroll-based interaction.
>	
>	Also, no-one interacts with steppers! (Especially on mobile.)
>	
>	Not saying that scrollers are inherently good, or that all the kinks have been ironed out. But I think we should be trying to iron out those kinks, not reverting to a form of storytelling that user testing tells us is a big turn-off for most people.

>	I’m fascinated by your hatred of scrollytelling -- always interested in hearing your next critique and curious if you'll acknowledge its advantages.  
>	
>	Here's one scrollytelling example I like https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/12/the-dark-side-of-guardian-comments   The charts flawlessly enter and exit the article, showing up when they're needed but not dominating it like they would if all 6 were shown in sequence, and also not burying charts as a stepper would.  Now, there is some information in this article that is buried -- there's an interactive quiz and it only provides the first question until you answer it.  I think that agrees with my philosophy well -- you should only have to click when you need to provide input to the page.  "I want to continue consuming this article / sequence of information" should not require a click.  ("scrolling is a continuation; clicking is a decision" http://bokardo.com/archives/scrolling-easier-clicking/ )
>	
>	Then there's the excellent http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/01/09/sports/the-dawn-wall-el-capitan.html which seamlessly responds to the natural "give me more" scrolling gesture.  Imagine how much would be lost if this was done with a series of still images and a stepper.  Or even if you kept WebGL and animated between different rock face positions for the story points, you'd lose the natural in-between transition that scrolling gives.  Stepper control would be more difficult and the experience less rewarding.
>	
>	A well-known stepper that uses transitions instead of discrete charts is http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/19/upshot/3d-yield-curve-economic-growth.html but that has flaws too.  Look at the caption for slide 6: "the same chart as from above".  Well, with this free-form navigation, who knows where you're entering that chart from?  If it's not a step to the left of it, that caption is entirely wrong.  And the first 6 slides are different views of the same chart with transitions between them, but slide 7 switches to Germany, and the only way that change in context is shown is by *lack* of transition.  If it was scroll-controlled maybe the US would naturally scroll off the stage and Germany would slide in, or maybe they could do it in-place with a scroll-controlled transition -- e.g. if opacity is used to reveal the incoming Germany chart over the US, the user could have full control over that fade
>	
>	Sure, the yield curve stepper could be modified to address the flaws I mention, but it's worth considering if the best stepper version of this visualization is better than the best scroll-navigated version.  Steppers do one thing well: exact control of steps.  You click, it goes.  Scrollers offer other advantages: easier navigation (scroll effort &lt; stepper discovery &amp; click effort), better delivery of your complete message (not buried behind multiple clicks), and full user control over transitions.  The biggest question with scrollers is if you can get the scroll input and page response to feel natural.  Not all scrollytelling is good, but I&#039;ll argue that in terms of joy and user experience the best scrollytelling interactive delivers more than the best stepper interactive.

The results of the study also showed parallax scrolling to be more effective when used in a hedonic and fun context. In spite of these benefits two of the participants suffered motion sickness and experienced significant usability issues while interacting with the parallax scrolling website. "

Jonas says…

Matt says…
>	The problem with a stepper is that if your last few steps contain the big reveal in the story, how many people make it through to the end? Take this recent one as an example, its not story points but uses tabs to navigate through. https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/what-will-brexit-mean-uk. The first page has 41k views, 2nd - 3.5k, 3rd 1.8k, 4th 1.3k last 1k. Its not scientific and no doubt there are subtleties,  but does the click to the next page approach mean that your readers never make it that far through the story? If your conclusions or big reveal is not up front there is a danger of people not seeing it. In this case its not a story so much as was to delve into the details behind the headlines and is a good example of front loading

Matt says…
>	Would be interesting if Tableau Public has any data on click through rates for storypoints, find out what % of people click through to the end and what the drop off rate is.

>	In fact, Mr. BB has enunciated the main reason people like them: the "awesome" factor. Things that look kewl are popular, even if that kewlness comes at the expense of usability. Steppers may be easier to use and more intuitive, but they lack the kewlness factor.
