However, to be able to allow the workers to get paid on MTurk, you need to have each survey have a unique Survey ID which is then entered into MTurk by the users to get their payment. This is apparently much easier to do in Qualtrics than in SurveyMonkey.

For this reason, I think if you do it this way using SurveyMonkey, you can say to the IRB that you promise to not try to re-identify the people by going back to your MTurk account and cross-linking the Survey IDs.

The colleague and I found (given our topic) that a preponderance of the n=60 were Democrats who were lower income, and this will have a profound effect on the results of surveys on most topics, I believe. I strongly advise against using MTurk for anything but exploratory research that is taken with a grain of salt (as my colleague was doing).
