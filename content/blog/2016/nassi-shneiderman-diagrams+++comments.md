>	Thanks for turning me on to this! I'll have to try it. My first impression is that it takes up less space and looks more neat than the traditional flow chart. Also, it looks like there can't be too many decisions in the chart or the trees will get to tiny. FYI, I use Gliffy.com for my flow charts and I think it works really well - I recommend it:  https://www.gliffy.com/ (Just a personal note - I'm not connected with the Gliffy company in any way.)
