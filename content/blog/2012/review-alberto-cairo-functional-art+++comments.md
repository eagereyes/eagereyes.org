>	I read the Spanish original several months ago and the Lamarckian evolution bit totally derailed me too. I must have re-read that section half a dozen times, thinking I must have been reading it wrong or mis-translating it in my head. Very odd, glad it wasn't just me who was puzzled by it. Otherwise, great book.

>	I am a student in Prof. Cairo's second installment of Introduction to Infographics and Data Visualization MOOC, and based on the reading I have done so far from Functional Art (required for the course), I would have to wholeheartedly agree that it is an excellent resource, both theoretical and practical, on how good visualizations are made.  Your review has convinced me to take the plunge and buy the book, in order to access the interview materials you mentioned (can't miss Cairo and Rosling bantering about what makes a good graphic!).

I, too, read it over several times and realized that he was contradicting himself by warning against the dangers of assuming form should always be constrained by function in biological terms... but then embracing that very same notion at the end as a principle of good design!
