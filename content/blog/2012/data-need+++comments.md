Maybe I'm a wonk, but the first graph shows me everything you were trying to make clearer already.

Changes in slope would also simply look more attractive than discontinuities. (And it might be more representative of the real world - real prices of goods and services don't all change simultaneously.)

>	I forgot to mention averaging, etc., I certainly thought about that. The problem with this data in particular is that a LOESS, moving average, etc. would either produce a lot of nonsense around the jumps or have to follow the data so closely that it wouldn't add anything. I also think that there needs to be a level of interpretation, otherwise we're not actually gaining anything. There is no explanation when you simply point to the data.

>	Perhaps an accidental point you have made is the difference between data exploration and story telling. The original plot had all of details that lets you wonder and ponder, but did not tell a very clear story.  By grouping and averaging, the final plot tells a specific story. Fictional story telling often leaves out details for you to fill in; Scott McCloud hypothesizes in "Understanding Comics" that this omission of details enables us to be more engaged in the story.  Perhaps there is a corresponding operation in non-fiction where detail omission focuses attention to specific items, thus thread a cohesive story through a large amount of details.

>	Your own comment on the final story is, "That is my version of the story, based purely on the numbers."  However, you pull in information that are not present in the presented data set when you tell your story you include extra information.  For example, "Those [gains] ended suddenly in 1970, at a time of high inflation..."  How much did performing the grouping influence your discovery of the external fact (inflation in the 1970s) and how much of your prior knowledge influenced your groupings (several of which appear somewhat arbitrary to me)?

>	The original plot shows the data. The second and third plot display a <em>model</em> of the data. The model enables you to tell a nice story, but as others have pointed out, some people might disagree with your model/story and want to propose their own models that tell different stories.

>	What is interesting to me is the pre-1970 to post-1970 data. The US enjoyed a monopoly in the world during the decades prior as both Europe and Japan needed to rebuild from WWII. The benefits of this monopoly appeared to get shared somewhat via the minimum wage, but once it ended it reverted.

>	The point about exploration vs. storytelling is not accidental at all; in fact, that's the main point here! Exploration obviously requires as much of the data as possible, but my point is that for storytelling, we'll want to reduce it.
>	
>	The comment on inflation is actually based on the steep downward line in the 1970s, so it is actually based on the chart and data shown. But there is no question that I have a particular view of the data, how could I not? I don't even think that a story should be objective, since it can't be, anyway. We might as well run with it.
