This paper choose to first examine the static visual affordance of visualization techniques, which is a fundamental first step before other variables can be added. Honestly, we are surprised that few has studied such basic affordance of these popular visualization techniques before.

The fact that these fundamental questions were not answered even after so many years does not flash a healthy sign. While some may prefer to focus "complex" and "broad" issues, it's dangerous to do so without answering the basic and fundamental questions first. As a community, this is an important question to be pondered.
