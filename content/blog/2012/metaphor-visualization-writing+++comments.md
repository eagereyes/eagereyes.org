>	Good article. Re. "...A high data-ink ratio is equivalent to ... an information-words ratio: the number of words (or amount of ink) on a page that do not carry unique information should be minimal." Sounds like the signal-noise ratio (of which data-ink ratios are one specific example).

However, parts of the signal are more fully understood by a reader in a philosophical frame of mind, parts by a more rigidly analytical frame of mind, so, within this discipline, adding certain well placed non-information flourishes that stimulate the appropriate mindset minimises the actual degradation of the signal. By a signal-noise ratio based on minimising the actual degradation of the signal going from the author to the reader, it improves.

At last, prose and poetry can communicate any information in some way, while data viz is only supposed to be communicating numbers, isn't it? So when you say, "We need to be aware of our expectations when we judge a data visualization or infographic." are you implying that the expectation may *not* be to gain some understanding of the data? That's... rather hard to understand without completely breaking the definition of what data visualization is.
