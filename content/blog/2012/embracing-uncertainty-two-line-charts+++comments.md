>	Nicely done, Robert. I'd love to see a similar treatment for electoral vote polling data. A not-quite-as-good graph ran in 2008; I'm sure it'll be back this year:

>	A three-area chart is clearly better than a two-line chart, but is it really better than a three-line chart? The undecided trend is not very clear because the top and bottom of the area are moving at the same time, and the area alone is hard to perceive without an alignment. I made a line chart that shows two things about the undecided trend: first, that it fell quite sharply in the first few months, then suddenly leveled off in a dog leg; and second, that it has risen steadily but very very slowly since then. I don't think those two things are clear in the area chart.

>	First, just to nitpick:
>	"The reason for making this part transparent is so that the crucial 50% line is visible: we can now see whether the president’s approval rating is above or below 50%"
>	It's important to note, I think, that this is only true in this chart because the results tend to hover around 50%.
>	The undecided could easily be a solid white, and a separate line could be drawn at the 50% mark.

>	Second, @derek:
>	I would argue that yes, it is more effective than a chart with three lines, depending on what you are trying to display.
>	The area chart, in this case, does a fantastic job of showing the relationship of the three categories, with the undecided taking a little bit of a supporting role instead of standing on its own. I feel that it is appropriate for it to do so here.
>	
>	If the trend of the undecided category is important enough to highlight to that extent, I would argue for a two chart display, because three lines on one chart would not have anywhere near the impact of the area chart above.

>	I'm kind of curious about the psychological reasoning for choosing a horizontal timescale for the graph given it means using a "top" and a "bottom" for each of the sides (and the reasoning for each).

<a href="/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Robert Kosara</a> says…
>	Timelines are typically drawn left to right. In this case it works, because we're looking at approval and disapproval, i.e., positive and negative.
>	
>	But you're right that in the case of two candidates that would be more of an issue. Left-right works when it the two parties, but what do you do during the primaries? There is almost always going to be some level of arbitrary choice to make. You don't need that when there are two lines, but then the chart is also much less informative.

>	True, although past doesn't dictate the future, especially given polling figures focus more on trend and current values than too much history, unless context is added.

>	The other problem for primaries is allocation of colours, given that a selection of party colour may also be due to underlying bias?

Jamie says…
>	If we were talking about the showing the approval numbers for two different parties, where we had to choose one to put on top and one on the bottom, then no - this set up would not make sense, for many reasons.
