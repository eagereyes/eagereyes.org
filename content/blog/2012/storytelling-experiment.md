# A Storytelling Experiment

I need two minutes of your time. By clicking on the following link, you will be taken to one of several slightly different versions of <a href="http://manaskriti.com/gdphist/">a visual story about the development of the gross domestic product (GDP) in different countries</a>. Watch it, play with it, and if you like it: share it. You will help us understand which types of storytelling work and which don't. There is no annoying survey, just a little story.

This is as much an experiment in running experiments as it is an experiment on storytelling: we're measuring the effectiveness of the different versions by tracking how often they are shared. Since we want to explore the real-world response of real people, we can't force them to sit down in front of a computer in a lab and act naturally. So instead, we want to watch how things get shared organically based on their merits.

Two minutes is all it takes. <a href="http://manaskriti.com/gdphist/">Participate in our storytelling experiment here</a>.
