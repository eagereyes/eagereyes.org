It took a lot of try and error to find when and where my inputs register. At first I thought I was seeing an animated .gif, not an interactive visualization.

Once the framework is done pouring in new data in the same narrative structure would then be a matter of drag and drop.

>	Hi - honestly, I did not become excited.   
>	1) I want scale labels that are informative, clear and annotated, so that we are in the right context. Why did the author pick the historical starting point...was it arbitrary or was it meant to reflect pre/post industrial revolution (a very Western-centric concept that may not be helpful when looking broadly, geographically)? And the vertical axis - am I looking at GDP growth?  I'm assuming its YOY. 
>	2) I want to understand the why of what the author is trying to show.  The only discernible headline that speaks to this is the annotation of data points - the last one that reads...'is China set to overtake?'     
>	3) I want to be compelled by the information.  I become compelled when there is a hypothesis presented in the headline and an exhaustive challenge of the information through the visualization.  If GDP growth is a measure of dominance (and what is dominance, anyway?) then there are plenty of smaller countries who have high volatility in their GDPs.  This will create social, political and economic volatility within their borders, but it is not a measure of global dominance.  
>	4. I want to be intrigued, challenged or surprised by the information.  This happens the most when I am presented with 'in spite of' types of competing factors.  For example, a country with explosive GDP in spite of lack of technological investment, human resources, or social unrest.

>	I was more interested in the experiment than the graphic and would have preferred to see all the various approaches and then decide which one I like best.  I'm not convinced that measuring 'likes' is a useful metric for effectiveness.
