>	1. <i>Exploratory</i> data analysis. Number crunching, data processing.
>	2. <i>Creative</i> idea generation. Data sketches, experiments. (not necessary if you're simply tasked with producing some figures or simple charts)
>	3. <i>Journalistic</i> application of analytic focus. Paring down to a clear story, message or view. (not necessary if you're simply preparing data for interested, committed and able others to analyse)
>	4. Finishing. Design refinement, checking, proofing.
