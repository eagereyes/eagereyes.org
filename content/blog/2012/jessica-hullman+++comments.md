Analysts have their own tools and skills.

It would be like giving a cake-making kit to a chef. They'll keenly examine it, critique it, and offer their professional opinion of it, and if it's very good they might even be inspired by it, but they won't use it. It's not for them. They make cakes their own way.

These are for interested or committed non-statisticians: people already interested in the meaning of that data, but not able to just pick up the raw data and analyse it in R. They are, first, about comprehension, exploration and learning/discovery, and second, about enabling detailed analysis (where doing this doesn't compromise a non-statistician's comprehension). Not achieving this second purpose is where flashy, intriguing, but shallow visualisations fall down.

>	Then there are infographics - which are for people without a _committed_ interest in a topic (yet). They  are, first, about encouraging interest and attention in the meaning of the data, second, about comprehension exploration and learning/discovery (this is where all that bandwagon-jumping linkbait falls down), and third - for the very best in class - about enabling the detailed analysis which the most enthused consumers might now be inspired to want to do. Achieving this without compromising the essential first and second aims and losing the attention and interest of your difficult-to-reach audience is damn hard to do, but when it does work, the results are awesome.

>	Personally I totally agree with Few on his viewpoint of these papers. I don't think I can do a better job in defending it. And I am sorry but his analysis is not superficial, and if you have read his work - you would know his position.
>	
>	I do want to tackle one point you make: " The power of visualization is not that it’s such an accurate representation of data ... more holistic view of data, which a table simply cannot provide"
>	
>	I think no one here is arguing that sometimes tables are better than visualizations, and sometimes a visualization is better than a table (Few has covered this over over himself). The argument is that some visualization have problems - simple problems that have been clearly documented and proven by several people, and not just Few.

>	Pie charts are useless in 3d, or 2d (or 4D if someone events it). A simple usability test will show you that most people can't comprehend easily whets in the chart. People are looking at data to get insights, and understand it quickly. Any form of display that makes it hard, is bound to fail.
>	
>	Lastly, one point I want to make - as a designer of analytic interfaces for companies I find most of the work from the infovis community to be USELESS. Sure they try new things, they test the limits, but honestly the majority of these papers rarely can be applied are worth applying in real world. I think these researchers need to go on the field and properly test their concepts. (and I am sorry but doing a catalog of charts built by other companies and giving your opinion without any proper testing of it - shouldn't be called research)

>	Thank you for sharing these papers! Few's article sets up a silly strawman with that ridiculous pie chart and, I think, deliberately misunderstands one of the benefits of academic research: standing on the shoulders of giants and pushing us to think differently about things (you know, learning!). Hullman wrote an academic paper and it should be read as such.

>	I create quantitative graphics in my work as an economist. I work on securities litigation, so my audience is a judge or arbitration panel (usually lawyers by training) that doesn't understand the material all that well. I want to do anything I can to help them learn (even if it means you take a few minutes to explain something to everyone) and understand the analysis. If people feel that you taught them the idea, rather than just stating the conclusion, they find you more credible. That sometimes means repeating certain elements in a graphic (putting information in the title and in the legend and in a caption) or presenting information in a less-than-perfectly-efficient manner because it is expected (say, if the opposing economic expert witness has already used a certain format - better to stick with it than introduce a different format for everyone to learn). Efficiency is nice but the ultimate goal is to convince everyone of something (like, my client's argument is the right one).

Meic Goodyear says…
