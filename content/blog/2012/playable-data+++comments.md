>	My interaction/aesthetic criticisms aside on this app (and there are many), I appreciate you touching on this study. I agree there is much potential in gamification and much ground yet to be covered. Particularly interesting is how this gaming lends itself well to bite-size stages of progress - an adventure game teaches you how to interact with the world and explore the landscape before it assumes you can make predictions, take risks, and save a damsel in distress. This controlled information output perhaps could be seen in data visualization that rewards a user with more complexity as they've demonstrated understanding simplicity. Would be curious to see if anyone is trying this.
