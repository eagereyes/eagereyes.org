>	I wouldn't say it's that much of an art in this case. Using areas to compare quantities is a basic mistake, and is probably always going to result in a bad design. You'd have to be David McCandless to think otherwise.

>	I agree about area being a pretty obvious bad choice, but making visual math work is quite hard and is something I haven't seen done much. It's often easier to provide some interaction instead of, not in addition to, visual math.

>	I thought this article was great and agree with most of what I read. However, I don't think that using areas to compare quantities is ALWAYS a bad idea. If the data you have is simplistic and must be shown visually it can help out an otherwise boring visual. And yes, ideally, you wouldn't chart boring data at all; but sometimes it's necessary.

>	While I of course respect what you may think (and by introducing regularity, your visualization makes it a bit easier), your belief isn't consistent with the research this. However, rather than pointing you at academic papers, how about playing a game:

Michele says…

Jonathan says…
>	I think what you describe in making your visualisation goes to the heart of what infoviz design is about. That is, the balance between deriving accurate (notice I didn't say "precise") information, and the desire to be "satisfied" in some way, usually aesthetically, but not always. Most designers occupy a position between Tufte on the former side, and McCandless on the latter.

>	While I don't have a design for the census data that's better than an interactive bar chart itself, I would be more satisfied by the addition of supporting data (such as what the immigration/emigration was 10 years ago). Such addition would be easy with a bar chart, which is also why I would prefer that. I am also attracted by brevity, and the bar chart solution could easily work at a quarter of the size I think, which is not true of the area approach.

>	But in the end, I think the thing that really matters is whether anyone who is actually interested in the subject matter feels they are enlightened by the presentation of this data in this way. Since I am not that interested in census data myself, I don't really see much wrong with your desire to make it look nice.

>	The one thing I would suggest you consider though is the fact (and I, along with many others, take it to be a fact) that the biggest problem with the state of design today is that most designs are made to be sold, but not be used.

>	I thought another way to look at this data would be in the form of waterfall graphs, where the individual changes are added to get a cumulative change. For example, the waterfall chart for Boston looks like this:
