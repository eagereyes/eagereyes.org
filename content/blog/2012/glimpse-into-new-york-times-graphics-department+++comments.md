>	I am from Ukraine. And you might be aware that Ukraine had some troubles with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Duranty#Reporting_the_famine" rel="nofollow">how she was treated by NYT reporters back in the dark days of the communism.</a> It took decades and a strong pressure from outside for NYT to acknowledge the crime of deception and disinformation committed on the pages of this news outlet.
>	
>	But lets look what <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/ukraine/index.html?8qa" rel="nofollow">does NYT write about Ukraine now.</a>
>	<blockquote>But a year and a half after taking office with a vow to pursue close ties to Russia, Mr. Yanukovich was overseeing a broad crackdown on the pro-Western opposition that mirrored the kind of pressure tactics used by his allies in the Kremlin.</blockquote>
>	
>	The sentence is if not a total and complete bullshit but is very close to one.
>	
>	First of all, the opposition that is claimed to be under pressure now was not pro-Western at all. It just happens so that the "leader" of the "pro-Western" opposition, Mrs. Tymoshenko, is the most pro-Russian politician this country has seen in the last 20 years. There is absolutely nothing, zero, void pro-Western in the policies she implemented.
>	
>	Second problem with this statement is claiming that Yanukovitch has "allies" in Kremlin. This statement is also a very close one to be called bullshit. After winning the Presidency Yanukovitch was pursuing policies and actions most anti-Russia that this country has seen in the last 8+ years. This resulted in yet another trade war war with Russia, just for example.
>	
>	Lets go further:
>	<blockquote>She was accused of working against the country’s interests by signing a deal to buy Russian natural gas while in office in 2009 at prices that prosecutors say were inflated…</blockquote>
>	No, she was accused of abuse of powers that resulted in extraordinary big damage to the country. <a href="http://ukr-nationalism.livejournal.com/1790033.html" rel="nofollow">More here</a>.
>	
>	Yes, the prices are inflated (compare $500 per 1000m³ Ukraine pays now with around $80 per 1000m³ on Henry Hub this winter). But the contract was written so that it was essentially a total and complete capitulation and surrender of the whole country to the KGB rulers.
>	
>	If Yanukovitch did not refuse to fulfill the contract in full, there would be Ukraine no more. And remember, NYT calls Tymoshenko pro-western whilst Yanukovitch is pro-Russian.
>	
>	And this is only a single and tiny example of lies spread by the paper. And I was not talking about the professional <a href="http://books.google.com.ua/books/about/Econospinning.html?id=TX-4AAAAIAAJ" rel="nofollow">econspinner Paul Krugman...</a>
