>	Wonderful concept, thank you for introducing it.  Looking at the goal of the visualization should give designers an idea about the degree of affordance to include for users.  An electronic commerce site, for instance, should be absolutely transparent to facilitate easy interaction by almost anyone.  However, the point of many computer games is to make the affordances difficult to perceive.  I wonder if the developers of Windows 8 had many gamers on the UI team?

>	Robert,
>	I think you're spot on with the idea of affordances in visualization. An interesting question with affordances is what are learned and what are natural. Most affordances are learned. Think of a caveman and a button - he wouldn't necessarily know what to do. Therefore there may be affordances built into visualization that we have learned from other fields. An obvious one is that we tend to read left to right and down (at least in English) so there is an affordance that lends more importance to the top left. If you think about play buttons on VCR, DVR, etc. They always move to the right. That's another affordance in visualization.

>	Great post! I talk about affordances when it comes to designing data visualizations (even static, offline data viz) in my workshops. For me, these are visual (rather than physical) characteristics of the graph that help make it clear to the user how to interact with it (e.g. selective strategic use of size, color, etc. to make it clear what is the most important that should be paid attention to first, what is next most important, and so on).

>	Another issue that I come across a lot is the idea of an inverse affordance (ok, I made that up but...) where by something looks significant, it implies meaning, or looks like it should be clicked/interacted with but ultimately turns out to be a red herring and is a decorative device and nothing more.

>	Not inverse affordance but "false affordance", as defined by William Gaver in 1991. Great minds think alike, Andy. Just not at the same time in this case :-)

>	BTW I think the HCI community is gradually coming round to the idea that affordances (more accurately, Don Norman's clarification of his "perceived affordances") are really just learned conventions. In HCI (as opposed to the physical world), there's nothing about a bevel on a button that makes it seem any more or less clickable than a flat colour field. It's just that we've learnt to recognise that the bevel signals a button. So you could say that Norman hijacked the original definition and ultimately applied it wrongly - there is nothing innate about HCI. Mainly because a million years ago we didn't have computers.
