>	"The closest hotels are in the Second District, Leopoldstadt" - there are three very close hotels right next to Techgate, although they are probably expensive I assume, one is the "Arcotel Kaiserwasser" (~100ms) as mentioned on the EuroVis Page, the second one is the "Park Inn by Radisson Uno City" also very close (~200ms) and the third one is the "NH Danube City" also approx. 200ms away (also mentioned on the Conference Webpage).
