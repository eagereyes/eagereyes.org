>	There's also the question of visual material that is present not to convey the content but to make it memorable, to fix the image in the memory. Frances Yates's book The Art of Memory has some very useful stuff on this from the pont of view of an academic historian of ideas.

>	For an example of "useful junk" take a look at the graph here which discusses the child mortality in India. In this case I would not even refer to it as junk. It forms an essential core of the graphic.

>	Look at page 59 of Tufte’s <i>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</i>. The decorations around this chart match those of the Victorian era. I don’t consider these decorations to be chartjunk since they are not part of the graph itself and do not interfere with the data. If anything, they call attention to it. I consider a pretty picture next to a chart or an elaborate border around a chart to be similar to Tufte’s decorations. They may add context or alter the mood but are not chartjunk since they are not part of the chart itself.
