# New Posting Frequency for 2012

In my enthusiasm about <a href="/blog/2012/why-i-switched-drupal-wordpress" title="Why I Switched From Drupal to WordPress">switching to WordPress</a>, I made the mistake of tweeting about potentially increasing my posting frequency in 2012. While I have tried to stick to a roughly weekly schedule in the past, there have been weeks when I did not write anything. My hope is to increase the frequency to roughly twice a week and see how that goes. <a href="http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/">John Peltier</a> and <a href="http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/posts/">Jorge Camoes</a> are planning on doing the same.

Jorge has been on fire lately with his posting on <a href="http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/patterns-of-knowledge/">Patterns of Knowledge</a> and his <a href="http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/a-course-for-the-invisible-data-visualization-users/">new series</a> that is starting with a brilliant basic question: <a href="http://www.excelcharts.com/blog/data-visualization-excel-users/what-is-chart/">What is a chart?</a>

Jon hasn't written anything so far this year, but perhaps this posting will give him a jump-start.
