>	Interactive visualization is absolutely the future.  Most people, sadly, have never seen their power, and most toolkits today are architected to be one-way flows of a data space -&gt; screen space pipeline.  Whenever I showed off <a href="http://code.enthought.com/chaco" rel="nofollow">Chaco</a>'s interactive demos to people, their eyes lit up and they immediately "got it".  But most people, even if they can imagine such fluid interactions, have trouble comprehending the immediacy and subconscious understanding that interactive graphics provide, until they use them on a real problem or dataset in their domain.

>	In order for interactive visualization to become a tool within reach of average designers and data researchers, better toolkits (and, dare I say, languages?) for visual specification have to be designed.  Even something as new as VizQL, for instance, is designed to express a one-way transformation of data.  The linkages between data is implied in the schema of its data sources, and perhaps some amount of interactivity could be automatically introduced into the plots as a result of this (c.f. Spotfire), but I believe that both Tableau's and Spotfire's approaches are fundamentally limited because they treat the graphics specification language as a separate domain than the data transformation language.

>	Agreed that interactive infographics are important but they have been in production for at least a decade. A site I contributed to and eventually managed has hundreds. The sad part is that even though the site was started around 2000, the staff that contributed the content peaked at about 10 and is now limited to one person who's primary duties are print-based. That says less about its value and more about corporate journalism's lack of vision.

>	Personally, I would argue the democratization of data is the future, meaning data is presented in ways that average people can consume. That includes interactive data visualization and things that haven't yet been conceived. My question for the group is, "Is the open data movement meaningless if only us propeller-heads and decision makers pay attention?"

>	Yes.  Information graphics is a subcategory of communication.  Visual communications is oftentimes the only way to make sense of large size or high dimensional datasets.  If people are to be truly literate with infographics, they need to be able to read *and* write them - which is why I made the earlier point that new languages are needed for expressing interactive graphics.

>	The same with infographics. We spend way too much time discussing them. Marketeers know that a cheap infographic can get traffic and they will use them ad nauseum. Then they'll move on to the next goose with the golden eggs. It's in their nature. Bad music and bad infographics will always have their audience as long as it can be monetized.

>	What can the data visualization community do? It can try to improve awareness and graphicacy skills but I don't see that. Could replace the hundreds of bad charts in the Wikipedia but they are there, waiting. Yes, the high-end is sexy and I love a well-designed infographic, but it doesn't change much at the bottom.

>	The flashy/ shallow Infographic, the simple analytical tool, the DIY data visualiser and the raw data aren't meant for the same people. Why should we be surprised when each of those outputs don't land effectively with a wide audience.  Each of them was only ever intended for a specific target group of people.

>	I agree that Interactive Visualization is part of the future, but would add that we need to learn how to make visualizations more usable. We must also not forget the power of animation on visualization. How data moves will soon become a part of the importance of how it looks. Look not just to interaction designers, but filmmakers, too.
