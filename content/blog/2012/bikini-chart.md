# The Bikini Chart

The Obama administration released a chart a while ago that shows job losses during the last year of the Bush administration and the first year after Obama took office. The chart is simple yet effective in the way it communicates a message. It also has some very subtle design elements that communicate a much more negative undertone than is immediately obvious.

I have to say that I have admired this chart since the day it came out. It is clean with just the right amount of decoration to work: scales and legends that explain what we are seeing. The colors are based on the typical colors associated with the Republican Party (red) and the Democrats (blue). The data is also indisputable, coming from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.

The chart shows the number of jobs lost per month over about two years, ending in early 2010. The message is clear: things were getting worse under Bush but have been getting better under Obama. It doesn't take a lot of skepticism or knowledge of politics to know that things don't happen that quickly, but the message still comes across quite clearly. (Click image for larger version)

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/obama-job-loss-chart.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1774" title="Obama Job Loss Chart" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/obama-job-loss-chart-600x334.png" alt="" width="600" height="334" /></a>

It is interesting that they chose to use bars that are pointing down rather than up. In a way, that makes sense: negative numbers typically are represented by bars that point down. But the number of people who lost their jobs is not negative, it's only negative if you look at it as "negative job growth." This was clearly a conscious decision. Since almost all the numbers are negative, it might have still made sense to show them pointing up though, to make the chart look less unusual. Its shape has earned the chart the nickname <em>bikini chart</em>, though.

But the downward-pointing bars communicate something beyond the values: there is something wrong here, these bars should not be pointing down. While longer bars are often better (more income, more votes, etc.), this is not the case here. This choice of direction for the bars explains what the viewer should be looking for.

The inverted version of the chart below shows why bars pointing up would have been much less clear: the shorter bars under Obama look like something is decreasing, which is surely is not a good thing, right?

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/obama-job-loss-chart-inverted.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1773" title="Obama Job Loss Chart, inverted" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/obama-job-loss-chart-inverted-600x289.png" alt="" width="600" height="289" /></a>

All of these are good choices and make the chart both attractive and effective. This chart is one of the cleanest examples of political communication I know, and it is based on actual, real data – imagine that!

But there is also something devious going on here. The choice of colors is the only logical one given the political context, but there is more to it. The red is quite a bit darker than the blue. That is not a bad choice in principle, since it makes it easier to tell the colors apart when the difference is not only in hue but also in brightness. Of course, the blue could have been darker than the red as well.

The second design choice is one I only discovered fairly recently. It is a lot more obvious in the inverted image than the original, too: there is a gradient in both colors from light at the top to dark at the bottom. That is not very obvious in the original version, since we expect lighter colors at the tops of things and darker colors at their bases. After all, light tends to come from above, and the lower parts of things are where shadows are cast. Only in this case, the effect makes the brightness differences in the colors even stronger. The dark red is close to black, and the entire red-to-very-dark-red gradient is somewhat suggestive. What else is red and turns black? Drying blood.

In addition to that, I believe that the dark color, especially towards the lower end, makes the red bars appear heavier than the blue ones. Since they are also pointing down, the additional weight might make them appear longer, or at least cause people to remember them as longer. Vertical bars appear longer than horizontal ones of the same length, and it may well be that the combination of bars hanging down from a baseline and the heavier color have a similar effect.

This is unproven at this point, but if I am correct I think it opens up some interesting possibilities. It means that we need to be much more careful with our choice of color, since the perceived weight might influence the way the data is read and remembered. Even if long-term recall is not a goal in visualization, we have to remember what we just saw when we switch between views as we think about our data. Subtle shifts could make a big difference if they make some values appear just a bit larger or smaller than the others.

The bikini chart is a great example of just how strongly simple design choices can change the appearance of a simple bar chart. Even if my speculation about weight is wrong, the other choices communicate and explain what the viewer is supposed to look for, without the need for explanatory text or a "shorter bars are better" annotation. That's pretty good for a simple bar chart.

Mike Wirth says…
>	I enjoyed your take on this, Robert. Though I think your read on the colors is very speculative. A quick google search reveals several versions with different approaches to the color scheme. Some are balanced in saturation and lightness while others aren't. I would offer that the strong possibility that the origin of the color scheme in the version you reviewed just might be insensitive and chosen by a perhaps untrained designer or computer scientist. I am, however, enthused by your love for the classic bar graph. I enjoyed this piece.

David C says…
>	The chart is mistitled as Job Loss.  The numbers on the vertical axis are negative, which signifies negative job loss; taking the title and numbers as they're displayed means more than -750,000 jobs were lost.  But since the negative of a negative is a positive, that actually means more than 750,000 jobs were gained at the end of Bush's term.  I'm sure that's not what the producer of the chart intended to show.  That's why to be correct, the chart should be titled Job Gains.

David C says…
>	By flipping the bars to point upward, you've inverted the vertical axis so that negative numbers of larger magnitude are positioned higher, which can be misleading--or at least confusing--because it defies convention.  If you changed the vertical axis labels to positive numbers, that would be more accurate.

David C says…
>	The choice of colors and their saturation does appear odd.  Perhaps they were chosen to maintain contrast in black &amp; white printing?  If so, they still could have gone with a more "Republican" red and "Democratic" blue.

>	Because of this chart, I'm never going to look at another bikini the same.

>	Robert, Thanks for this deft analysis. It is great to see an appreciation for the subtle touches that can make a chart effective in communicating a message. The use of color gradient and axes shows that good visualization is a lot more than just a war on chart junk.

>	the use of gradient to distort perception of heights, and various tactics which range from subtle alteration to blatant manipulation, can also be found in this chart which is paraphrase of the one you dissect: http://www.parti-socialiste.fr/articles/la-droite-est-responsable-de-l-explosion-de-la-dette-publique

>	I think the inversion is the most clever aspect - I don't see doing this as a way to fake out the viewer - as you mention, it aids in understanding, while also promoting the point being made. Maybe the dried blood analogy is a little bit too much for me though. Nice analysis.

Thomas Gibes says…
>	Thanks for writing this up! The Bikini Chart will serve as a prime example of a rhetorical visualization for years to come, I'm sure. I've always thought <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EQhAKiXaEJQ/TyvqgkFWwSI/AAAAAAAAMDM/G_ErFTiSxkM/s1600/PercentJobLossesJan2012.jpg" rel="nofollow">this chart</a> was a good response to the bikini chart. The power lies in the data set chosen - job gains/losses per month, which provided such a pleasing, symmetrical (and political valuable) chart formation. But when you look at the total percentage of jobs lost you realize the huge unemployment gap that still persists despite these job gains.

Ira von Talk says…
>	Great analysis. I think the light blue is the "Obama blue" used very well in the now classic Change poster.

John says…
>	As for the chart, I'd have rather seen # of losses in full time jobs as many people, though working, are now on part-time vs. previous full time or holding multiple part-time jobs.  Just to say they have a "job" doesn't mean what it used to.

Athix says…
>	They chart is beautiful and quite well-done.  Unfortunately is is also a perfect example of the limitations of informational graphics, as much as I love them.  The graph could as easily be used in a textbook on propaganda as it could in one on statistics.  The poster above illustrates one reason - the viewer has no idea what kind of jobs are being measured.  Second, we are unable to know what other variables are involved in the numbers.  We are led to think this wonderful improvement is due to Obama or his adminstration's grasp of economics.  It is possible this is true... it is also possible that it is not, for any large number of reasons.  The Fed, off-year elections, world economic factors, business factors independent of anything the U.S. Presidency influenced, etc. etc. etc.  Correlation vs. Causation is the knife-to-the-heart of many infographics, but that won't stop any of us from enjoying them.
