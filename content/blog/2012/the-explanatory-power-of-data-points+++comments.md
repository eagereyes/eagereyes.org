Many visualizations, including storytelling visualizations, are analyzed with the user mentally comparing the visualized data with some implicit idea of what 'no effect' looks like. Yet, rarely do you see the null hypothesis actually represented on the graph. Another common type of visualization that comes to mind for this type of annotation are bar graphs, wherever the goal is to show a difference between groups. Error bars tend to be misinterpreted, but small marks next to each bar could show the point above/below which that bar's value represents a significant difference given another bar's value.
