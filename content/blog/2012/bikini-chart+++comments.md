>	I enjoyed your take on this, Robert. Though I think your read on the colors is very speculative. A quick google search reveals several versions with different approaches to the color scheme. Some are balanced in saturation and lightness while others aren't. I would offer that the strong possibility that the origin of the color scheme in the version you reviewed just might be insensitive and chosen by a perhaps untrained designer or computer scientist. I am, however, enthused by your love for the classic bar graph. I enjoyed this piece.

>	The chart is mistitled as Job Loss.  The numbers on the vertical axis are negative, which signifies negative job loss; taking the title and numbers as they're displayed means more than -750,000 jobs were lost.  But since the negative of a negative is a positive, that actually means more than 750,000 jobs were gained at the end of Bush's term.  I'm sure that's not what the producer of the chart intended to show.  That's why to be correct, the chart should be titled Job Gains.

David C says…
>	By flipping the bars to point upward, you've inverted the vertical axis so that negative numbers of larger magnitude are positioned higher, which can be misleading--or at least confusing--because it defies convention.  If you changed the vertical axis labels to positive numbers, that would be more accurate.

David C says…
>	The choice of colors and their saturation does appear odd.  Perhaps they were chosen to maintain contrast in black &amp; white printing?  If so, they still could have gone with a more "Republican" red and "Democratic" blue.

>	Robert, Thanks for this deft analysis. It is great to see an appreciation for the subtle touches that can make a chart effective in communicating a message. The use of color gradient and axes shows that good visualization is a lot more than just a war on chart junk.

>	I think the inversion is the most clever aspect - I don't see doing this as a way to fake out the viewer - as you mention, it aids in understanding, while also promoting the point being made. Maybe the dried blood analogy is a little bit too much for me though. Nice analysis.

>	Thanks for writing this up! The Bikini Chart will serve as a prime example of a rhetorical visualization for years to come, I'm sure. I've always thought <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EQhAKiXaEJQ/TyvqgkFWwSI/AAAAAAAAMDM/G_ErFTiSxkM/s1600/PercentJobLossesJan2012.jpg" rel="nofollow">this chart</a> was a good response to the bikini chart. The power lies in the data set chosen - job gains/losses per month, which provided such a pleasing, symmetrical (and political valuable) chart formation. But when you look at the total percentage of jobs lost you realize the huge unemployment gap that still persists despite these job gains.

>	Great analysis. I think the light blue is the "Obama blue" used very well in the now classic Change poster.

John says…
>	As for the chart, I'd have rather seen # of losses in full time jobs as many people, though working, are now on part-time vs. previous full time or holding multiple part-time jobs.  Just to say they have a "job" doesn't mean what it used to.

Athix says…
>	They chart is beautiful and quite well-done.  Unfortunately is is also a perfect example of the limitations of informational graphics, as much as I love them.  The graph could as easily be used in a textbook on propaganda as it could in one on statistics.  The poster above illustrates one reason - the viewer has no idea what kind of jobs are being measured.  Second, we are unable to know what other variables are involved in the numbers.  We are led to think this wonderful improvement is due to Obama or his adminstration's grasp of economics.  It is possible this is true... it is also possible that it is not, for any large number of reasons.  The Fed, off-year elections, world economic factors, business factors independent of anything the U.S. Presidency influenced, etc. etc. etc.  Correlation vs. Causation is the knife-to-the-heart of many infographics, but that won't stop any of us from enjoying them.
