>	Is there any chance that I can lay my hands on the related paper? I am working on a team that is creating the next version of data exploration tool for high schools students called Fathom. As we gear to create this next version, I am scouting for any and all research in the field of data visualization and am really interested in what you are doing.

Is there some general rationale to design the multi-touch interaction for visualization forms? Look forward to have chance to read above mention paper.

Robert Kosara says…
>	That might work, but I'm not sure if it really would help. The placement is actually quite easy to figure out by just moving your fingers around on the trackpad. I think any visual aid is going to end up being more confusing and distracting than helpful. But I haven't done a user study, I'll definitely need to try out a few variations.

Robert Kosara says…
>	The main reason is that I find most existing parallel coordinates tools cumbersome and slow to use. I also had the idea first when thinking about parcoords. Plus, they are a very well-studied and common technique in visualization, so they kind of present themselves as a testbed. But I definitely want to extend this idea to other kinds of visualization and other interactions as well.
