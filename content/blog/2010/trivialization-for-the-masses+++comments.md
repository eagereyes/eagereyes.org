There is no question that there are good examples when you look at competitions, conferences, etc. But when there is no incentive other than semi-anonymous credit and warm fuzzy feelings, people will put in hours doing fairly mindless stuff, but not spend the same number of hours thinking deeper and figuring out.

>	Many Eyes only gave us a small number of view types.  I am just starting to analyze the views published on Tableau Public.  Many workbooks contain dashboards that combine multiple views into rich analytical experiences.  The average is 2.2 sheets per dashboard with a tail up to one dashboard with 15 sheets.  Almost half the dashboards contain filter widgets, which suggests an analytical experience involving raw data.  I still need to collect data about brushing and linking.  You avoid trivialization by making it easy to do open-ended authoring.

Wordpress as a tool is a major Open Source initiative, not to mention the open sourcing of application frameworks and languages - allowing for new innovation on the shoulders of other improvements.

Robert Kosara says…
>	The incentive would be to come up with exciting new insights. Learning a programming language or a tool is one thing, but figuring out something entirely new should be much more rewarding! I think the problem is the open-endedness of the task: you don't know where it'll lead you, and you might not even know when you're done. That seems to scare away a lot of people.

>	You really think that people put together these examples just for an ipod touch?! I really doubt it - these are visualisations that people have created for their own work and their own understanding, and the prizes are just an incentive to get them to share.

>	OTOH I agree that crowd sourced analysis is basically ineffective - to really contribute to a data analysis, you need to immerse yourself in the data with a rich analytic toolkit.  Manyeyes is fun, but gives nowhere near the depth you need to discover much other than the trivial.

>	The problem might simply be that the type of people who have the skill sets to create visualisation tools are not necessarily the type of people who have the abstract big thinking analytical minds. I work in the area of open access to scholarly publishing and am on the thinking side of the equation. It is very challenging because I am reliant on the technical people to build things for me and often there is considerable resistance because they don't always understand the point (or why precious resources should be diverted in this direction).

>	The amount of effort to interpret the data is much greater than just visualizing it.  For example, you can create a scatter plot easily, but to evaluate whether there is correlation and causation is much more involved.  As H. Wickham pointed out, interpretation requires you to "immerse" yourself in the data.  You have to be an expert on the data to begin to interpret it.  There may be interpretation going on, but not in public.  Also, the interpretation is open to debate and people may not want to make the effort to take a stand on one side or the other.  They're more interested in the tools and techniques.

>	Is it really that people want more expressive or "deeper" tools?  There are plenty of websites that provide non-trivial visualization and even analytical capabilities.  I think a lot of the problem is that people who are interested in combining analysis with visualization are doing so for research purposes.  If you do that in a public forum you run the risk of killing a publication before it really gets off the ground.  Combined with the "publish or die" mentality at research groups around the world, it provides incentive to hide your results and analysis as much as you can.

>	Robert, your lament is echoed elsewhere in a recent <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=820">blog post by Stephen Few</a> regarding business intelligence software.  The wall Few refers to separates "technology-centric, engineering-oriented" activities from those that are "human-centric, design-oriented".  I see visualization being the former, and analysis the latter.

>	I don't think the fear of being scooped is the biggest factor - it does take more effort to work openly, especially when web based tools for data analysis are not as powerful as desktop based.  Why work on your analysis publicly when it's much easier to do it privately?

>	I think many people respond well to challenges. The reward can be monetary such as the famous <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix prize</a>, but more often than not - solving a problem and presenting a clever solution is enough of a reward. The ggplot case study competition that Hadley Wickham referenced in his first comment to your post is a good example. The bi-annual <a href="http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/">data expo </a>that the American Statistical Association runs or the <a href="http://hcil.cs.umd.edu/localphp/hcil/vast10/index.php">VAST challenge</a> at visweek are other good challenges that get the creative juices flowing.

>	There is certainly a difference between manyeyes (which is mainly a "visual dump" of data, which hardly can tell us the story behind the data) and the ggplot case studies (which show the presentation graphics of what was the result of an analysis).
>	
>	But in both cases we do not see anything about using graphics for actually exploring the data. This is not really surprising, as the cumbersome process of analyzing data (which might not be too cumbersome with the right tools) often goes into dead ends and several iterations, that no one really wants to present.
>	
>	When we want to promote the (right) use of graphics, we need to go beyond showing the polished results in fascinating graphics - this is what people know at least since Minard ... The real challenge is to convince people that their analyses can benefit greatly from using graphics. Most statistical and visualization packages fail to support this kind of thinking - at least they don't encourage the user to use graphics in exploration.
