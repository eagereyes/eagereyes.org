>	One simple way to check whether a visualization tells a consistent story is to empirically test the idea. Have there been any studies examining the differences in how people tell a story from a visualization? I imagine there must, but I'm completely ignorant of the storytelling subfield in Vis.

>	I agree that people tell stories but I disagree that a single visualization cannot BE storytelling.  Fundamental to visualization is the elements that establish the semantics of the marks on the page - headers, labels, captions, titles, annotations, etc.  Although I do not read French, I suspect these elements in Minard's visualization of Napoleon's March quickly help the reader understand the topic of the story that Minard is trying to tell.  Once you know the semantics, his view is powerful storytelling (at least for me).  Furthermore, it covers the same time span as War and Peace and does it in a single page.  Both are great examples of storytelling - they just tell different stories.

>	both @ visweek and back in my organization there seems to be several meanings associated with story.
>	broadly speaking, some qualify commentaries, or mere descriptions as stories. It is in that sense that "charts tell great stories", meaning something can be told about a chart, which is fortunately most often the case
>	In a stricter sense, stories have a narrative structure. They are a process. They take the reader down one specific and narrow path of understanding. They leave little room for interpretation. As such they need to be told in a way. A visualization can be designed to tell its story although its often achieved by devices around the visualization proper (introductory text, voiceover, instructions, etc.)
