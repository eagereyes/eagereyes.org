There're some great stories you can tell about how people have used visualisation, and they're very useful in explaining the value of our work, but a lot of results aren't a very interesting story in themselves.

It's hard enough trying to explain it in person at a pub (napkins and pens help a lot). On the plus side, a short video (as in, for example, your parallel coordinates multi-touch work) can make everything clear, and we're now at the stage where it's not unusual to be watching a clip to help understand something.
