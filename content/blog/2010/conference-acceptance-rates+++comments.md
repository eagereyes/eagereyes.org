Robert Kosara says…
>	There are certainly limits, a very low acceptance rate can be problematic. That's also the reason CHI didn't just decide to keep the number of papers constant and let the acceptance rate go down to 10% or so when submissions were increasing.

>	But it's still meaningful. There's no question that a conference with a 25% rate will have higher-quality papers than one with 40% or more. A rate around 20-25% is probably the best: it's selective while still leaving room for new ideas. And it's also a question how democratic and open the community is, and if it's controlled by a few powerful people.

>	I am completely with you that extreme rates may be a hint that there is something wrong with the conference. But what makes a good conference? If it is just a "meeting" of the "best" papers, we are only generating CO2 by flying there. But seriously, meeting "the right" people, having the chance to bump into each others and exchange ideas is probably far more contributing to a  good conference. The citation count is probably another thing you need to believe in, and often there is the correlation you have been talking about.

>	Good academic work is not necessarily bound to playing according to the commonly established system. Or vice versa, there is far too much happening in the community which just pays homage to the system. Both your suggested measures are tightly bound to the system - which may certainly be a good orientation to start off.

Robert Kosara says…
>	Thank you so much! I'll update the page and data files right away.

>	Thanks also for the names of the chairs, I'm going to ask them for the missing acceptance rates. One problem I see with the move towards electronic proceedings is that they don't seem to include those prefaces (at least VisWeek 2009 didn't), and the digital libraries are sometimes missing pages.
