>	I'm very happy to see a focus on this area - I won't be able to attend visweek this year (my theory paper was rejected... ha!) but I will be very interested to see the results from this workshop that you're able to publish in the not too distant future. I think that for the good of the field there will need to be vibrant community of theoreticians who can advance/challenge the science. There are very good reasons why tool/application papers are abundant (funders like to see stuff, we like to make stuff), but I think the reasons why theory hasn't moved as quickly are less understood. At least part of the problem is that it's not easy to conceptualize what constitutes a significant advance in theoretical pursuit.
