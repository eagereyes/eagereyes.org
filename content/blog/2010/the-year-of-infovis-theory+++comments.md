>	Dear Robert
>	
>	Congratulations on your achievements in the field to date - I'm an avid reader of your blog. Just following up your blog post about research in the field to briefly introduce you to some work I've conducted and will be looking to publish over the coming weeks/months.
>	
>	Just to introduce myself. I split my time between being an Information Manager at the University of Leeds, UK and the very busy early days of running my own company 'Visualising Data Ltd.' which I incorporated just over a month ago. 
>	
>	I've developed a particular passion and knowledge about the subject over the past 3/4 years having spent all my career in information management and then more recently through a Masters research degree I undertook to study a particular aspect of the subject I wanted to explore further. This concerned my experiences of the paradox between how people perceive aethetic design of graphs vs. how effectively they read graphs - the classic form vs. function story.
>	
>	I set up a survey-based experiment with 160 participants which involved them subjectively recording the amount they 'liked' 8 different graph renders based on the same values/graph type. These designs varied in render from the most Tutfe-like priniple-based designs through to highly decorated 3D designs.
>	
>	Participants were then faced with 32 questions asking them to read values from a sample of graphs based on the design they most liked, followed by 32 further questions but this time based on the best practice graph design.
>	
>	The results revealed that over 65% of participants selected 3D graphs as their favoured renders. The associated graph reading performance revealed significantly weaker levels of accuracy from participants who undertook questions based on their 'favoured' 3D designs compared to those who prefered the better practice designs. There was a huge amount of additional detail to the experiment that presented very interesting results which I won't go into now. 
>	
>	As I say, I'm trying to find time to write this up - I completed it last July so it is certainly in need of immediate action! I would be really interested to receive any pointers for specific publications or forum that might be suitable for such work? I've narrowed down a selection of journals that seem to be most likely to try and target: Information Design Journal, Parson’s Journal for Information Mapping, Visual Communication Quarterly, International Journal of Information Management and Behaviour & Information Technology. The barriers I may face, however, are that I'm not an academic and so may lack the necessary credentials to break into some of these areas.

>	That sounds like an interesting study. Depending on how much time you have to work on it now, you could also consider submitting to the [Information Visualization conference](http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/infovis_cfp_papers.html) (due March 31st) or sending a poster there (due July 1st). The latter is a good way to get word out and talk to people to get a feeling for how well the work is received in the community.
>	
>	You don't need particular credentials, but you do need to be careful especially with user studies. There are some pitfalls and common mistakes that people tend to make when they don't have enough experience. So be prepared to get the paper rejected once or twice, and/or get help from somebody in the field.

>	Many thanks for the response and advice Robert. As you say the former might be a bit stretching but the poster idea sounds like a good option.

>	Hi Robert:
