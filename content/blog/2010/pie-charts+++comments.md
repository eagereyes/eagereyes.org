Sure, you can't tell between the small differences between slices, but at the end of the day, the visualization is just a guide to show you where to look in your data.</p>

The problem with pie charts that they almost never get used in the right way, and there are so few situations in which they can be used well, that it's usually just hopeless. You may as well argue that 550cc motorbikes are a good idea for 16 year-old boys - if they ride them in the right way.

Cortez Brayboy says…
>	You can use all three, but only for the identical purpose of showing value in a whole picture. The reason is you would need to show trending times of value, fluctuations and other factors. More than one pie graph would be needed because of the times of value recorded; related to the line or bar graph chosen.

I've always felt that a two-segment pie (what Jorge Camoes calls a one-segment pie) is somewhat effective if used appropriately. It's good to see a good analysis that shows how to maintain their effectiveness.

>	
>	Those two sentences are wrong. If you compare like with like, then the sum of the bars must be 100% (or 1 if using proportions). Therefore increasing the green bar will mean that one or more other bars will reduce in size. The percentage increase has to come from somewhere. 
>	
>	Following on from that, comparing like with like, the bar chart implicitly allows the comparison with part to whole. as the whole is always 100%.

BOi says…

HLeplaa says…
>	You make the total larger, for instance going from 100 to 110% (which becomes the new 100%). To calculate how percentages change then, you have to calculate the factor to make 110 into 100 (dividing it by 1.1). So: 33% becomes now 30%.
