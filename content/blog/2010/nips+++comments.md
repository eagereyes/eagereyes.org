>	Great post -- dialogue with the Machine Learning (and statistics) community is vital if visualisation is going to realise its long term potential for exploratory data analysis, as well as communication. The problem is, how do you convince a member of the machine learning community that human visualisation can uncover information that algorithmic methods can't? The best answer I know is to show them Anscombe's Quartets (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet).

(I'm pretty sure that this is a corollary of the No-Free Lunch thereom http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem, but haven't managed to prove it yet)
