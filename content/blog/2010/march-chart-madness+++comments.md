>	I agree with almost everything you've said here. But wrt the transit graph - Chicago and LA are similar?? More than twice as many people use transit in Chicago as LA, roughly 2/3 the number drive, and roughly twice as many people walk! I actually found the graphic quite readable despite some of the concerns you brought up - especially for making quick, rough comparisons on transit patterns (which is the intention). Some small numbers might have helped. But perhaps the distortion is worse than I thought if you are seeing Chicago and LA as similar - 50-100% difference is not a small differentiation!

>	I'm not so sure about the second problem you found with the waves of colour graph. Making everything above 20 the same colour could well have been intentional, since it's mostly just noise. They probably should have made a scale that says 20-100 -> this colour, but then you lose the sense of proportion.

Robert Kosara says…
>	That may be the reason, but it's still the usual terrible rainbow color scale. The colors aren't equally far from each other perceptually, so you see all kinds of boundaries that aren't actually there. The colors' perceived brightness increases and decreases without any clear direction (which makes telling values apart harder). The legend is only a part of the problem here.
