I also implemented a ribbon visualization a while ago for a company, and used less saturated colors there. But they were still a bit on the glossy side and didn't have the charm of the hand-drawn ones. It would take using some more advanced CG techniques to make these things look better, but it's definitely doable. Glossy, high-contrast, primary colors are definitely easier to do, though.
