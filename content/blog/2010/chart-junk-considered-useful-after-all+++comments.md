>	I guess the obvious follow-up work is to study the amount of misleading that chart junk can cause. That is, if chart junk is increasing memorability, then are people taking the graphical  message and ignoring the data? I expect so. And then, chart junk should really be seen as a commentary on the data, and all that this entails.

>	In this vein, an interpretation of this paper could be "chart junk considered malicious". That is, it not only obscures the data, but it directly misleads the reader. He thinks he learned about the data, but retained the information about the graphics. Trouble is, the graphics were created by the artist, and not by whoever collected the data...

>	Your test of the monster versus the graph says that the former "gets the message across".  But all sorts of things get the message across without being information, or while being inaccurate information.

>	I ask you to imagine now a cartoon monster that had the same caption, but no information in the teeth at all, and I put it to you that that monster would also please the readers of the newspaper more than the bar graph would, and would get the message across. The paradox can only be solved by assuming that actual information does not matter at all-- all that matters is that people find the picture engaging.

>	Thanks for the post and the link to the paper. you know I'm all in favour of controlled chart junk. I feel that Tufte rules apply more to people who create charts to explain stuff with data (analysts), than to those who use them to support a point (journalists, advocates).
>	I wouldn't want the monster on an SAP screen, for instance. well, I kind of would, but I reckon it wouldn't be efficient. 
>	My concern, which the paper seems to address, is that people may remember the chart more than the message of the chart, like those TV ads you know by heart, but couldn't tell what products they are for

>	Well the idea obviously is that the embellishments tell the same story as the data. It would be interesting to do a study to see if people can tell when the data and the graphics around them don't agree. There's also the possibility of distorting the size of the change, though that doesn't seem to have been an issue in these cases; they're actually designed rather well.

Robert Kosara says…
>	I think you're taking this a bit too far. A pure graphic that does not contain any data has less authority than one that does. It's certainly something to look into, in fact I can think of about a dozen studies to clarify some points and ask further questions. In the same vein, you could argue that an article saying "Unemployment rate rising! We're all doomed!" without any numbers would be as good as one that discusses the actual change. All that text is nothing but embellishment, after all.

Robert Kosara says…
>	I don't think that's the case, though. The recall scores for topic, message, and trend were very similar. Of course, it all depends on how much you add, and you clearly can overwhelm the user. The other thing is how much time they had to look at the images: a quick glance in a typical newspaper-reading scenario would not be as effective as being able to study the chart for a few minutes (there was no time limit in the experiment).

>	Really interesting. I have a few thoughts. (1) Usually when I think of chart junk these are not the types of things that I have in mind. I usually consider chart junk to be all those miscellaneous lines and marks that are added to graphic and just make it busy. A classic example is the default excel plot that has horizontal lines. These are totally extraneous 99% of the time. I think the examples in this post are really quite a different thing. Technically, you can call them chart junk, but they transcend the term, in my opinion. (2) All of these examples of illustrative charts are really well done. The imagery reinforces the message in the data. Achieving this kind of unity of message between image and data is really, really hard. I don't worry much about people who are actively trying to mislead---because what can you do about that? But what are the consequences of people who try to punch up their data with imagery but ultimately just produce something confusing. Aside from making me cringe and normalizing mediocrity, do these things usually interfere with interpretation? Can we develop guidelines that will allow people to experiment in this realm while also minimizing confusion?

>	I'd argue that "chart junk" is too broad a stroke to be classified as useful or not. We’ve all seen cases where graphics distract – or worse – mislead the reader. On the other hand, Holmes and this paper clearly show that what falls under the current definition of chart junk can actually be useful. 
>	
>	I think a great distinction is mentioned in the paper; <cite>“[Holmes] regularly incorporates strong visual imagery into the fabric of the chart.”</cite> By merging the image with the data, the chart presents a more integrated, whole idea the reader can take away.

>	One top of mind example where chart junk is not combined with – nor supportive of – the data is located in this <a href="http://www.retrevo.com/content/blog/2010/03/social-media-new-addiction%3F" target="_blank">retrevo article</a> about social media. The stock photos/graphics are loosely connected at best, and make it hard to focus on the data. This would be an interesting set of charts study.

>	I'm a fan of Tufte; he says "show the data". As long as the embellishment does not negatively affect the clear and accurate presentation of the data (which many do) then there's no particular harm.

>	Interesting article and thanks for posting.  I think how much you embellish depends on your audience.  In Made to Stick,(http://lccn.loc.gov/2006046467) the authors warn against the "curse of knowledge".  The person may know so much about the data and want to communicate it's nuances that they forget their audience and end up with a dry chart. 
>	
>	If your audience is a general audience, then some embellishment is OK provided you don't misrepresent the data.  In a small group that you know is going to delve into the data themselves, then follow Tufte's advice and minimize the non-data ink.  I suppose there is a continuum between the two that makes it difficult.  That's where I think the art in information visualization comes in. Knowing when and how much to embellish.

>	I have to wonder what the effect would be if the 'monster' were used for the cosmetics data and the 'girl' for the political expenditure. To be sure, they are memorable but they also convey meaning...the girl being less manipulative. Honestly, I prefer the creative challenges of making interesting and memorable graphics but in a world where buzzwords, branding, rhetoric and snap judgements rule, this causes me not a little concern.

>	I was really looking forward to this post (and to the incoming comments). This post is about openness and dialog; it's a step (at least this is my hope) in the direction of crossing the boundaries. That is what we need to face the complex issue of exploiting, making really accessible and usable, the huge amount of data and information we have around.
>	I think we (finally) touched here the key point of many discussions that cross and tantalize the (many) disciplines currently trying to exploit the value of data and information. The key point in my opinion is that in most cases - more or less - it's (also) a matter of cognition and communication. If we (could) assume this communicative and cognitive perspective, the bounds are necessarily blurred: it's very difficult - and even not useful - to separate, for example, data analysis from data communication: how much communication do you have in data analysis? Think to dashboards: which is the role of metaphors, rhetoric and communication in these kind of interfaces? I think - to be brief and crude - that all the interfaces that mediate the access to (and eventually the manipulation of) data and information are (have to be) to some extent "communicative".
>	I'm dreaming a (visualization) world where users - with both their two brain sides - and interfaces come first, than we'll have (the right mix of) methodologies and disciplines. It's a call for a real interdisciplinary approach, that will make the difference.
>	This is the line we're trying to walk together with researchers from statistics, semiotics and computer science.
>	
>	I add here also two comments I wrote last year on that. The first one relates to a contest launched by Flowingdata: we took the opportunity to make a quick experiment with our students. We participate with two very different visualizations in terms of "embellishment" (as it seems we should call the non-data components). The first entry "wons" the contest (Luca Masud's one: http://bit.ly/cnG2Q3), the second is here: http://bit.ly/cwkJBW.
>	What is interesting is not the result, but the comments received: most of them make judgments without any consideration on target, context, purpose: the main pillars and the starting points of any (visual) design process.

>	Hi all. Talking again about Nathan’s challenge, the visualization posted by Luca Masud (Nathan’s favorite, or, if you prefer, the Pollock-esque one) was an experimental contribution: we asked to some of our master students to use the challenge as an entry point, to verify some of their early hypothesis, and to get as much feedbacks as possible. Luca is currently working – he just started – on the intersection between consistency of data and visualization potentialities. His work is part of a more general framework that we (visual design) cultivates together with a department of statistics. We both (statistics and designers) believe that approaching complexity entails new communication challenges (i.e. considering and visualizing uncertainty) and asks for new tools. There is definitely no room here for a battle between aesthetic and function, between visual design and statistics. This is the time to consolidate the marriage.

Graham Bruce says…
>	The question of "If you subscribe to the Tufte school of thinking, the first chart probably made you cringe." with regard to the monster chart: the monster didn't make me cringe, more the 'minimalist' chart. 
>	
>	I'm of the Tufte school of thought. The 'minimalist' chart made me cringe as it's just really poorly excecuted. The border surrounding the plot area is unnecessary for a start (not really minimalist, is it), and the use of borders instead of colour fill for the bars is just tacky. 
>	
>	This is another example of editorial bias skewing an argument which doesn't really need skewed any further. The monster chart is well executed to fit it's purpose, as an editorial piece. The bar chart is terrible and serves no purpose other then to be improved.

Ravi Rikhye says…
>	I love the article. As a second-career teacher (now retired), may I remind that people learn differently. Those that are visual learners may well find the graphic representation easier. I'm used to the traditional representation. Aside from the difficulty of rapidly scanning the data when graphics are used, my mind takes off running on the graphics so its a huge distraction. Truth to tell, I don't like charts much either. Just the data is the best.
