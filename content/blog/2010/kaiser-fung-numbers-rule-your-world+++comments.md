>	Thank you for the review and letting us know about the book. Every now and then I have been looking for a book which explains the application of statistical principles without getting into the details of complex formulas. The problem being, quite often, authors ignore the 'why' aspect and get into the 'how' very quickly..Hopefully this writing style will inspire authors belonging to some other disciplines (linear algebra, machine learning are some of the other related areas which would be helpful to discover similarly) to follow suit..

>	Maybe it’s time to grab the Numbers Rule Your World book by Kaiser Fung. I kind of see your point there and I completely agree with you. Thank you for putting up a really good review on this book.
