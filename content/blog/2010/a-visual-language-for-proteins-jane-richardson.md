# A Visual Language for Proteins: Jane Richardson

Proteins are among the most complex structures we know. They consist of thousands of atoms, and fold into complex shapes to perform a variety of functions. Understanding how they work is not possible from looking at single atoms, but rather at the overall, three-dimensional structure. The visual language for doing this was developed by Jane Richardson.

I find it fascinating to learn that concepts and ideas that I take for granted were only invented relatively recently. When we look at visualizations of proteins today, we expect clean, relatively simple shapes: ribbons, helices, and the rope-like structures that connect them. But this is a very abstracted view that was not at all obvious thirty years ago.

Scientists only figured out how to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in the 1970s. When Jane Richardson was writing a review article about the proteins whose structure was known in 1980, she needed a consistent way of showing them. It was clearly not very practical (or useful for understanding) to draw thousands of atoms that were part of a complex, three-dimensional structure.

There are three distinct structures in a protein: <em>alpha-helices</em> (spiral shapes), <em>beta sheets</em> (ribbons), and <em>turns</em> (the "ropes" in-between). Seeing those in the atom structure (above) is almost impossible, but crucial for understanding how a protein works.

Jane Richardson's contribution was finding a visual way of representing these components of proteins. Her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_diagram">ribbon diagrams</a> simplify the structure of the protein, and at the same time focus on the important parts.  These diagrams were hand-drawn at first; today, any program that shows proteins includes this style of showing them, they are used in textbooks, etc.

I <a href="/blog/2008/sightings-structures-smaller-than-light">interviewed Richardson</a> for the <em>Sightings</em> column in <em>American Scientist</em> a while ago. She is a professor at Duke University and still uses visual means (virtual reality, among them) for teaching and research to further our understanding of complex molecules.
