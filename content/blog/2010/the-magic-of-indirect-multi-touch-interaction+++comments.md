>	If anything, I'd say it was the critics of large touch screen technology that lacked imagination.  For what is so set in stone about the vertical position of the large monitor? Isn't it just a hangover from the design of the typewriter (horizontal keyboard under hands, displayed text behind), and later the heavy and long cathode ray tube (that would probably have bumped the users' knees if set into a desk)?

The traditional "pen pusher" or clerk looked down on his work as he wrote with a stylus and pushed things around with his fingers, and certainly didn't have a reputation for large arm muscles.  For even larger displays, consider the traditional draftsman and his board, or the artist and his easel.  None of these trades seemed to have developed gorilla arms.

But "gorilla arms" doesn't convince me as fundamental problem.  It just sounds like someone isn't thinking through why they would still have a vertical screen at arm's length on a desk when the input technology changed.  Work displays themselves only <em>became</em> vertical because the input technology changed, and fairly quickly and recently too.

>	Of course, touching a button is much more direct than using a mouse or other pointing device. Many other things are easier done this way though. We've had touchscreens for a while, but they've only recently made any impact in the real world, and almost exclusively in handheld devices. I think there's a reason for that.

>	The lack of imagination comment was about the short-sighted way I see a lot if people simply combine touch interaction with current screens and UIs and think that'll work. The considerable design work in iOS and also the upcoming Windows Phone 7 (and the complete failure of dozens of tablet PCs running plain vanilla Windows without that) show how different these UIs have to be to work with touch, for example.
