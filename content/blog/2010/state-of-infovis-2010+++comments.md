Rather the common enemy is the static screen capture from Excel ("Next --&gt; Next --&gt; Finish") embedded in a Power Point slide on which are based million-dollar decisions every day.</p>

Although there are some guideline for visualiztion design varing from Ben </span>Shneiderman's mantros to Tuft<span class="SubTitle">'s principle,  I believe everyone has their own guidelines for information visualiztion design decision. It is a good time to put them together to discuss and purify.</span></p>

>	<p>So where does this leave Processing?  I've been writing an application in Processing so that I could bring in functional programming with Scala.  If Protovis integrates with javascript, how will it address the need for concurrency?  The reason I'm concerned is that my data gathering step took 3 hours with the java I wrote this Summer.  My inferior programming skills aside, is there a concurrent way to do the "suck up the data" step if I'm using ProtoVis?  Just curious.</p>
