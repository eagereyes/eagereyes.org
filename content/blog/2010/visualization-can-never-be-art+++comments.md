At one point he refers to people who create "anti-sublime" art as "scientific illustrators," but as I read this paper he isn't saying that the "anti-sublime" style precludes artistic content; rather, he sees true art as having a political dimension. His high praise of Josh On's "They Rule," which clarifies power relations, is a good example of how even in Sack's view art and clarity can coexist.

>	I really don't see why visualization can't be sublime. And I certainly don't buy that pragmatism is the opposite of sublime. As a great appreciator of pragmatism, I do find some solutions to be sublimely pragmatic. I really think that sometimes a visualization is so elegant and revealing that it transcends to the level of the sublime. Of course, this is rare, but no less awesome for its rarity. And let me tell you, not all paintings are sublime either.

>	Visualization and art shouldn't be at odds with each other.  The difference between the two is that the motivations behind their respective creations are entirely different.  Art is motivated by emotion - typically with the intention of evoking one.  Visualization is motivated by the need to quickly convey a large amount of information.

>	There is no reason why the two cannot mingle... visualizations that evoke an insightful "ah ha!" certainly create excitement and joy in those that view them.  But, ask any artist about why they do what they do.  More often than not you'll receive responses to the tune of "to make people think about ..."  This is almost the opposite of the purpose of visualization - "to make people not have to think about ... by making it immediately evident."

>	this is a pretty interesting article. However, while sublime is arguably a necessary quality for an artwork, I would not agree that visualization is anti-sublime. The anti-sublime is the abject. That is because the sublime is awe-inspiring and brings one to experience that he/she is on the verge of life and death, in the very active process of existing. The anti sublime is not the monotony and pragmatism of visualization but the process of existing within the evidence of decay/dying. Therefore visualization or other conceptions or arrangements of objects or data is not art not because the symbolic intention to make it art is absent.
