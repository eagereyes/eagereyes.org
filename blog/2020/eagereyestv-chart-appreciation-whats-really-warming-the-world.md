# eagereyesTV: Chart Appreciation, What's Really Warming the World

Line charts – they're not the most glamorous. And yet, they can be used to tell a compelling story about global warming. In this video, I talk about what I consider a modern classic of data journalism, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/">What's Really Warming the World</a></em> by Eric Roston and Blacki Migliozzi: how it works, how it's structured, and why it works so well.

That piece was a key inspiration for a short paper I wrote for EuroVis a few years ago on <a href="https://eagereyes.org/papers/paper-an-argument-structure-for-data-stories" data-type="post" data-id="10093">argument structure for data stories</a>. Watch the video here or <a href="https://youtu.be/Bjrb_ErvvPs">head over to YouTube</a>. The latter would be appreciated especially so you can hit the like button, which will help the video get seen by more people.

And as I say in the video, let me know what you think! Post comments here or on YouTube. Do you have other favorite pieces of data journalism?
