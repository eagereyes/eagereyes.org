# Video Series: Counting In 2021 with Mechanical Calculators

Mechanical calculators are fascinating. I may have gone down a few rabbit holes on this topic earlier this year, and acquired a few. As a little celebration of the end of this year, and to start the new one, I'm creating a small series of videos about them and releasing one each week.

Here's the teaser for the series, which I'm calling <em>Counting in 2021</em> (I've created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzq0eVw_4DneAHSq24wRJV48dcuEsTfL&amp;playnext=1&amp;index=1">a YouTube playlist</a> for your convenience, and of course you should <a href="http://youtube.com/c/eagereyes">subscribe to my channel</a> to be the first to see them when they come out!).

<p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5WTYeOyW5GI?si=w7nRukVLh4Nv4xd-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

The idea is to make them all follow a similar structure, with high production values (glorious 4K!) and not a lot of talking. There will be some, but there will also be a lot more music than in any of my videos so far. I really hope you like the soundtrack in the teaser, because you'll hear it again…

I won't post here about each individual one, but I will add links below and then post again when the series is complete. This is the plan:

<ul><li>12/21: <a href="https://youtu.be/3EMdtQ_o7ZU">Addiator and FEDTRO Instamatic</a></li><li>12/28: GEM Adding Machine</li><li>1/4: Swift and Hoffritz Calculators</li><li>1/11: Comptometer</li><li>1/18: Torpedo Schell-Addiermaschine</li><li>1/25: Curta</li></ul>

This is a bit of a departure from the usual programming here, but I hope the folks reading my blog and following my channel will find it interesting.
