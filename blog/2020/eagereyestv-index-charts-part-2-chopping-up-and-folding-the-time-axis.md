# eagereyesTV: Index Charts, Part 2: Chopping Up and Folding the Time Axis

I covered the more commonly known value index charts in my  <a href="https://youtu.be/qs7h19vaqQc">my last video on index charts</a>, this one is about indexing on the horizontal, or time, axis. It's kind of fascinating how you can fold the time axis to get a better view of your data. I show how it works and walk through a number of examples, using housing prices, camera sales, global warming, and even data about my running!

I'm again embedding the video below, but please <a href="https://youtu.be/0Yy90fvusEw">head over to YouTube</a> if you want to comment or maybe even give the video a thumbs-up.
