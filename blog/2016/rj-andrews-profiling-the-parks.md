# RJ Andrews' Profiling the Parks

<a href="http://www.infowetrust.com/">RJ Andrews</a> has created <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3zt7BXEMPQ">a great little video about the National Parks in the U.S.</a> Have you ever thought about how the different parks compare? Which one is wider, which one is deeper, which one's at higher or lower elevation?

I love the hand-drawn images and based on real data, and the way the zooming in and out give context. The video is well worth four and a half minutes of your time.

RJ has also written <a href="http://www.infowetrust.com/parks/">a nice posting</a> about the motivation for the piece, the data, the process, etc.
