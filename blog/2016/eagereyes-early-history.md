# Eagereyes' Early History

Just ahead of the first decade of this website's history clicking over, here's a look back at where things started. Some of those postings were terrible, some of them were quite prescient or are even still popular.<!--more-->

This is partly why I created the <a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog-calendar">interactive posting calendar</a>. It makes it easy browse postings just by mousing over, especially those early ones (clicking opens them in a new tab).

## The First Posting!

<a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2006/taking-visualization-to-the-next-level">In my first posting ever</a>, I immediately started bitching about the lack of theoretical foundations:

<blockquote>But in many ways, visualization is today mostly technical, empirical, and there is practically no theoretical foundation for what we are doing.</blockquote>

The writing in that posting is a bit tortured and it's no wonder nobody read it at the time. But I still believe all the things I talk about there, so that's not bad.

## More Early Postings

Things happened quickly in those early days! I didn't realize that within a few weeks, I had written a number of postings:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://eagereyes.org/applications/itunes-billion-song-downloads"><em>iTunes (Music) Store Billion Downloads Visualization</em></a>. The iTunes Store had just been renamed from iTunes <em>Music</em> Store (this was before the iPhone had even been announced!) and I was able to capture the data that was feeding a countdown counter on Apple's website. Sadly, I created the visualization in Java, which most people no longer have (and I also broke something with the embedding). I might build a web version of this at some point. This was my second posting ever though, kind of mind-blowing.</li>
    <li><em><a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2006/opining-or-murmuring">Opining or Murmuring: Infographics vs. Visualization</a></em>. Infographics and their relationship to visualization has been a recurring theme here. This very early posting linked to a piece by Kaiser Fung. When you look at the comments there, I thought his observation was really interesting. My posting probably came after that. Who says comments are useless?</li>
    <li>Criticism was a topic from the very beginning. Among the first few postings I'm finding <em><a href="https://eagereyes.org/criticism/visualization-criticism">Visualization Criticism – A New Way of Thinking about Visualization</a></em> and <em><a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2006/loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic">The Loneliness of the Visualization Critic</a></em> (title inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loneliness_of_the_Long-Distance_Runner">this great short story</a> I had read as a teenager).</li>
    <li><a href="https://eagereyes.org/criticism/informative-art"><em>When Informative Art Isn't</em></a>. Yeah, I was never afraid to pick fights. I criticized two related papers about a particular kind of ambient display. Lars Erik Holmquist, one of the authors of those papers, responded and it turned into a good discussion (we also later <a href="https://eagereyes.org/papers/vis-criticism">wrote a paper together</a>, where we used this as an example).</li>
    <li><a href="https://eagereyes.org/techniques/sets-of-possible-occurrences"><em>Sets of Possible Occurrences</em></a>. The first technique posting of sorts. SOPOs (as they're affectionately called) are an interesting theoretical idea, but a complete failure as a visualization.</li>
    <li><a href="https://eagereyes.org/zipscribble-maps/united-states"><em>The US ZIPScribble Map</em></a>. Posted December 1, 2006, this became the first really popular posting on this site. So popular in fact, that fights broke out in the comments and I had to delete some comments to stop the nonsense. This is still the longest comment thread on this site, I believe. The ZIPScribble Map is now interactive, includes many more countries, <a href="https://eagereyes.org/zipscribble-map">and lives here</a>.</li>
</ul>

## The First Comment!

Want to guess who left the first comment on eagereyes? Well, I'll tell you: it was Hadley Wickham! He argued with me in the comment section of <a href="https://eagereyes.org/techniques/square-pie-charts">this article about square pie charts</a> that they're really the same thing as treemaps. Some of the earlier postings have comments, but those actually came later.

I have a posting for later this week that will look at the time before October 1, 2006 – those days before, um, recorded history.
