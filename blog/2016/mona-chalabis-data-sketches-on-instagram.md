# Link: Mona Chalabi's Data Sketches on Instagram

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/mona_chalabi/">Mona Chalabi</a> has one of the most interesting Instagram feeds for people interested in data visualization. She draws data by hand. It's interesting data, too, and her approach is accessible and inspiring.

Mona is data editor at Guardian US, and was formerly at FiveThirtyEight and before that at The Guardian in the UK.

Her sketches sometimes are sometimes about sex or bodily functions, but there are also other topics – like candy or, recently, the Brexit vote in Britain. There are also some very good political pieces.

They're not always super effective as data displays, but they're always interesting and thought-provoking. Here is a random selection from her feed. You should just <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mona_chalabi/">follow her</a>.
