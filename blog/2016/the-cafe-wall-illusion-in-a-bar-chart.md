# The Café Wall Illusion in a Bar Chart

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_wall_illusion">The Café Wall Illusion</a> makes you to see perfectly parallel lines as being at an angle. It's a curiosity and a cool perceptual illusion – except when it shows up in a bar chart, as it did in this example.<!--more-->

The classic café wall illusion was first spotted on a tiled wall, where the misaligned black and white tiles were making the lines look all wonky (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Café_wall.svg">image from Wikipedia</a>).

<a href="http://allisontmccann.com">FiveThirtyEight journalist Allison McCann</a> recently tweeted this image, which also shows the illusion. This is the first time I've ever seen it in a bar chart.

It looks like that zero line is angled up slightly. I wonder if this would cause people to be slightly biased in their reading of the data.
