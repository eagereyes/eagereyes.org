# Blog 2016

### <a href="/blog/2016/a-roundup-of-year-end-roundups">A Roundup of Year-End News Graphics Roundups</a>
The end of the year is always a good time to look back at the great work done in the world of news graphics – and this year in particular, to relive all the heartbreak and disillusionment. Here is a list of year-end news graphics round-ups for your enjoyment and edification. _<a href="/blog/2016/a-roundup-of-year-end-roundups">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-dumbest-user-interface-of-2016">The Dumbest User Interface of 2016</a>
It is my great honor and pleasure to announce the winner of the Worst User Interface Award 2016: it goes to the new chip-enabled credit card terminals introduced in the U.S. this year. My congratulations, as it is very well deserved. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-dumbest-user-interface-of-2016">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/when-rankings-are-just-data-porn">When Rankings Are Just Data Porn</a>
Rankings are a common way of talking about data: who made the most money, who won the most medals, etc. But they hide issues in the underlying data. Is the difference between first and second meaningful or just noise? Here is a data video that nicely demonstrates the problem. _<a href="/blog/2016/when-rankings-are-just-data-porn">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-holiday-shopping-guide">The EagerEyes Holiday Shopping Guide</a>
Are you looking for the perfect gift for the data or visualization geek in your life? Did that crazy self-driving water bottle Kickstarter still not deliver, leaving you hunting for an overpriced Nintendo Classic? The EagerEyes Holiday Shopping Guide has all the geeky, uncool gifts you could possibly want. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-holiday-shopping-guide">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/review-jon-schwabish-better-presentations">Review: Jon Schwabish, Better Presentations</a>
Presentations can be dreadful. Badly thought-out slides, boring structure, poorly delivered. I once told a colleague after a practice talk to please shoot me before she’d ever make me sit through such a talk again (to be fair, she had called the talk boring herself before she even began). _<a href="/blog/2016/review-jon-schwabish-better-presentations">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-problem-with-vis-taxonomies">The Problem with Vis Taxonomies</a>
Most taxonomies in visualization and HCI are useless. They carve up the space, but they don’t provide new insights or make predictions. Designing a useful taxonomy is a difficult problem, but that's no excuse for publishing lots of mediocre ones. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-problem-with-vis-taxonomies">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/rj-andrews-profiling-the-parks">RJ Andrews' Profiling the Parks</a>
RJ Andrews has created a great little video about the National Parks in the U.S. Have you ever thought about how the different parks compare? Which one is wider, which one is deeper, which one's at higher or lower elevation? _<a href="/blog/2016/rj-andrews-profiling-the-parks">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/graphic-continuum-flash-cards">Graphic Continuum Flash Cards</a>
Jon Schwabish and Severino Ribecca have turned their Graphic Continuum poster into a set of cards. They're a good way to expand your visual vocabulary and find new ideas for how to represent your data. _<a href="/blog/2016/graphic-continuum-flash-cards">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/ten-great-talks-at-information-2016">Ten Great Talks at Information+ 2016</a>
The Information+ Conference took place in Vancouver earlier this year. It brought together people from information visualization and information design (and design more in general). All of the talk videos are online on the website, but since there were a lot and it's kind of hard to decide where to start watching, I'm listing my favorites below. _<a href="/blog/2016/ten-great-talks-at-information-2016">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/all-those-misleading-election-maps">All Those Misleading Election Maps</a>
Would you make a bar chart where the length of the bar doesn't actually scale with the number being shown? Would you draw a line chart with the lines all over the place, not where the values actually are? Of course not. Yet somehow, every single election map works like that. _<a href="/blog/2016/all-those-misleading-election-maps">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-thursday-friday-empirical-methods-better-presentations">VIS 2016 – Thursday, Friday: Empirical Methods, Better Presentations</a>
A panel on empirical methods, papers on time series, and perhaps the best capstone at VIS ever rounded out the conference on Thursday and Friday. _<a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-thursday-friday-empirical-methods-better-presentations">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-wednesday-thursday-papers-and-the-death-of-scivis">VIS 2016 – Wednesday, Thursday: Papers and the Death of SciVis</a>
Two more postings about VIS 2016 last week! Wednesday got a lot of us talking, with the Death of SciVis panel. There were also more papers on a variety of topics. _<a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-wednesday-thursday-papers-and-the-death-of-scivis">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-tuesday">VIS 2016 – Tuesday</a>
The official opening of the main conference was today, Tuesday. The conference is now in full swing until Friday. _<a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-tuesday">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-sunday-monday-beliv-and-being-contrarian">VIS 2016 – Sunday, Monday: BELIV and Being Contrarian</a>
The early part of IEEE VIS 2016 is already behind us. This includes many workshops, tutorials, as well as the Doctoral Colloquium. It has been an interesting three days (considering Saturday here as well). This posting is less a report as a number of observations from a several discussions and talks. _<a href="/blog/2016/vis-2016-sunday-monday-beliv-and-being-contrarian">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/common-speaking-mistakes-to-avoid">Common Speaking Mistakes To Avoid</a>
Whenever I go to academic conferences, I have to sit through some terrible talks. It continues to amaze me that so many people make mistakes that are so easy to avoid. Here are a few I noticed just in the last two days. _<a href="/blog/2016/common-speaking-mistakes-to-avoid">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/a-treemap-chart-pie">A Treemap Chart Pie</a>
After his recent early chart pie attempts, Ben Shneiderman has now achieved the ultimate in chart pie baking: a treemap chart pie. _<a href="/blog/2016/a-treemap-chart-pie">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/ieee-vis-pointers-and-vis-running">IEEE VIS Pointers and Running</a>
VIS is around the corner, taking place in Baltimore next week. Here are some pointers to a handful of interesting papers, as well as how to catch one of my live performances or attend the blogging and podcasting meetup – plus a reminder to bring your running shoes! _<a href="/blog/2016/ieee-vis-pointers-and-vis-running">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/an-empire-built-on-sand">Paper: An Empire Built On Sand</a>
It's not a secret that I think that we need to ask some harder questions about the foundations that we're building visualization on. In a paper to be presented at the BELIV workshop at VIS next week, I'm making the case for that more extensively than I have so far. The full title of the paper is An Empire Built On Sand: Reexamining What We Think We Know About Visualization. _<a href="/blog/2016/an-empire-built-on-sand">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-winding-path-of-data-analysis">The Winding Path of Data Analysis</a>
Data analysis is not a straight-forward process: you try out lots of things, you go down a path that seems promising but then turns out to not work out, and suddenly you hit upon the thing you were looking for. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-winding-path-of-data-analysis">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/a-decade-of-eagereyes">A Decade of EagerEyes</a>
So here we are. 10 years. A decade. 3653 days. 452 postings. Some good stuff. Some bad stuff. Some terrible stuff. A decade is a long time. But its end is also just the beginning of the next one. _<a href="/blog/2016/a-decade-of-eagereyes">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-origin-story">The EagerEyes Origin Story</a>
Have you ever wondered where the weird name comes from, what the site was like before it was a blog, and how it all got started? This posting has all the answers. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-origin-story">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/why-i-do-this">Why I Do This</a>
Why spend countless hours writing a blog like this? What do I get out of it? What do I hope to accomplish? What is the purpose? _<a href="/blog/2016/why-i-do-this">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/meet-the-new-logo-and-theme">Meet the New Logo and Theme!</a>
This site has gone through many different looks and designs. I haven't kept count, but I'd be surprised if it was fewer than ten. So far, they have all either been off-the-shelf generic designs or ones I had created myself. For its tenth birthday, I decided to splurge and get eagereyes a complete makeover: a new theme and a real, custom logo. _<a href="/blog/2016/meet-the-new-logo-and-theme">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-controversies">The Controversies</a>
I have opinions. I state those opinions. Not everybody likes my opinions. And sometimes it's not just a matter of opinion, but also of tone and approach. Criticism can be a useful tool or it can be an angry attack. Figuring out which is which isn't always easy while you're doing it. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-controversies">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/eagereyes-early-history">Eagereyes' Early History</a>
Just ahead of the first decade of this website's history clicking over, here's a look back at where things started. Some of those postings were terrible, some of them were quite prescient or are even still popular. _<a href="/blog/2016/eagereyes-early-history">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/blogstravaganza">The Ten Years of EagerEyes Blogstravaganza</a>
October 1 marks the ten-year anniversary of this website. Well, it’s really older than that, but the first posting in its modern history is dated October 1, 2006. To celebrate, this week will see a posting every day, so hold on to your hats! _<a href="/blog/2016/blogstravaganza">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/tapestry-2017-st-augustine-fl-on-march-1st">Tapestry 2017: St. Augustine, FL on March 1st</a>
We just announced next year's Tapestry Conference – the fifth episode (chapter? act?)! It will take place on March 1st, 2017, in St. Augustine, FL. We have three exciting keynotes, and we're looking for your talk proposals, posters, and demos! _<a href="/blog/2016/tapestry-2017-st-augustine-fl-on-march-1st">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/ben-shneidermans-chart-pies">Ben Shneiderman's Chart Pies</a>
So turns out Ben Shneiderman is into pies! Actual pies that is, but in the form of charts. Rather than, you know, the other way around. Feast your eyes on delicious-looking chart pies! _<a href="/blog/2016/ben-shneidermans-chart-pies">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/review-lupi-posavec-dear-data">Review: Lupi, Posavec, Dear Data</a>
Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec have turned their Dear Data project into a book. It's a great example of the kind of creative work you can do around visualization without computers, entirely by hand. What started with a simple idea turned into an amazing project. _<a href="/blog/2016/review-lupi-posavec-dear-data">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/nassi-shneiderman-diagrams">Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams</a>
Programming languages use words and symbols to represent structures like blocks and conditions. A visual representation of these structures seems useful to keep track of all the different cases, see the scope of variables, etc. Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams offer just such a representation. _<a href="/blog/2016/nassi-shneiderman-diagrams">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/stacked-bars-are-the-worst">Stacked Bars Are the Worst</a>
Bar charts are great. They always work. They're always the safe choice. Right? Well, no. Stacked bar charts are deceiving because we think they work just like regular bars, when they're really pretty terrible. _<a href="/blog/2016/stacked-bars-are-the-worst">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/two-ideas-for-a-better-visualization-web">Two Ideas for a Better Visualization Web</a>
There is a reasonable amount of information about visualization available on the web. There are still huge gaps though, especially when it comes to bridging the gap between academic research and the rest of the world, though. Here are two ideas: one simple, one rather involved. _<a href="/blog/2016/two-ideas-for-a-better-visualization-web">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization">The Repetitive and Boring History of Visualization</a>
When people talk about the history of data visualization, the same set of names always comes up: Playfair, Nightingale, Snow, Minard. They are historically important, alright, but why do they overshadow all the other work that was done? And what do we know about how important they actually were? _<a href="/blog/2016/the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-bits-are-rotting-in-the-state-of-data-journalism">The Bits Are Rotting in the State of Data Journalism</a>
News articles are an incredibly important source of historical information. Online media and interactive pieces are much more at risk of breaking or disappearing, at least in theory. Well, it's not just theory. A quick look around shows a number of even fairly recent pieces in major publications that are broken today. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-bits-are-rotting-in-the-state-of-data-journalism">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/a-reanalysis-of-a-study-about-square-pie-charts-from-2009">A Reanalysis of A Study About (Square) Pie Charts from 2009</a>
After my recent posting on the results of our pie charts studies, Jorge Camoes teased me on Twitter about square pie charts. So I dug up the data from a study we ran many years ago to look at how well they compare to bars, pies, and squares. _<a href="/blog/2016/a-reanalysis-of-a-study-about-square-pie-charts-from-2009">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/new-improved-traveling-presidential-candidate-map">New, Improved Traveling Presidential Candidate Map</a>
Many years ago, when this website was still young, I created a map of all the ZIP codes in the U.S. in numeric order and then wondered about the shortest path through all of them. I dubbed that The Traveling Presidential Candidate Map. Here is an improved version that's interactive and much more efficient than the old one. _<a href="/blog/2016/new-improved-traveling-presidential-candidate-map">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-cafe-wall-illusion-in-a-bar-chart">The Café Wall Illusion in a Bar Chart</a>
The Café Wall Illusion makes you to see perfectly parallel lines as being at an angle. It's a curiosity and a cool perceptual illusion – except when it shows up in a bar chart, as it did in this example. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-cafe-wall-illusion-in-a-bar-chart">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/an-illustrated-tour-of-the-pie-chart-study-results">An Illustrated Tour of the Pie Chart Study Results</a>
In two papers, Drew Skau and I recently showed that our idea of how we read pie charts is wrong, that donut charts are no worse than pie charts, and a few more things. Here is a detailed walk-through of the results of the three studies we conducted for this purpose. Let's go on a little journey through some real data and do a little science together! _<a href="/blog/2016/an-illustrated-tour-of-the-pie-chart-study-results">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/publicize-dont-just-publish">Publicize, Don't Just Publish!</a>
What does it mean to publish a paper? Is it just to add a bullet point to your CV, or do you want the world to know about your research? What does it mean to publish today? Here are some thoughts and pointers on how to get the word out about the amazing work you do. _<a href="/blog/2016/publicize-dont-just-publish">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/eurovis-2016-thursday-and-friday">EuroVis 2016, Thursday and Friday</a>
After Tuesday and Wednesday, EuroVis continued for the rest of the week. There were papers about visualization, interaction, networks, and other stuff, a dinner in a former church, and finally the capstone. _<a href="/blog/2016/eurovis-2016-thursday-and-friday">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/eurovis-2016-tuesday-and-wednesday">EuroVis 2016, Tuesday and Wednesday</a>
EuroVis 2016 is happening this week in Groningen, The Netherlands. This is the report from the first two-and-a-half days,  which saw some symposia, a keynote, and many paper presentations. _<a href="/blog/2016/eurovis-2016-tuesday-and-wednesday">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/eurovis-coverage-and-running">EuroVis Coverage and Running</a>
For people not attending EuroVis: I will be tweeting from there next week and write postings here, like I have in the previous years. For people who will be attending: let's meet up and run! _<a href="/blog/2016/eurovis-coverage-and-running">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/a-pair-of-pie-chart-papers">A Pair of Pie Chart Papers</a>
How do we read pie charts? Do they differ from the even more reviled donut charts? What about common pie chart designs like exploded pies? In two papers to be presented at EuroVis next week, Drew Skau and I show that the common wisdom about how we read these charts (by angle) is almost certainly wrong, and that things are much more complicated than we thought. _<a href="/blog/2016/a-pair-of-pie-chart-papers">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-scrollytelling-scourge">The Scrollytelling Scourge</a>
Scrollytelling is a common way of interacting with stories these days. Scroll down and the story unfolds! Except it's often awkward, brittle, and gets in the way. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-scrollytelling-scourge">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/row-level-thinking-vs-cube-thinking">Row-Level Thinking vs. Cube Thinking</a>
Our mental model of a dataset changes the way we ask questions. One aspect of that is the shape of the data (long or wide); an equally important issue is whether we think of the data as a collection of rows of numbers that we can aggregate bottom-up, or as a complete dataset that we can slice top-down to ask questions. _<a href="/blog/2016/row-level-thinking-vs-cube-thinking">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/openvis-2016-talk-videos-and-pointers">OpenVis 2016 Talk Videos and Pointers</a>
The OpenVis Conference had another great selection of talks this year. Here is a list of my favorites, with talk videos and pointers to some additional materials. _<a href="/blog/2016/openvis-2016-talk-videos-and-pointers">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/new-edition-of-designing-the-user-interface">New Edition of Designing the User Interface</a>
The 6th edition of Designing the User Interface just came out. This is one of the central books in HCI. This edition is also notable because it adds a lot of fresh blood to the list of authors. _<a href="/blog/2016/new-edition-of-designing-the-user-interface">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/mturk-ids-are-not-anonymous">MTurk IDs Are Not Anonymous</a>
The worker IDs Amazon's Mechanical Turk gives you may look pretty random and anonymous, but they can reveal personally-identifiable information. They need to be removed from datasets, especially when they are shared or published. _<a href="/blog/2016/mturk-ids-are-not-anonymous">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/3d-bar-charts-considered-not-that-harmful">3D Bar Charts Considered Not That Harmful</a>
We've turned the understanding of charts into formulas instead of encouraging people to think and ask questions. That doesn't produce better charts, it just gives people ways of feeling superior by parroting something about chart junk or 3D being bad. There is little to no research to back these things up. _<a href="/blog/2016/3d-bar-charts-considered-not-that-harmful">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/introducing-shift-register-my-new-electronics-blog">Introducing Shift Register, My New Electronics Blog</a>
I have started a new blog, which I call shift register. It's about electronics projects I'm doing, mostly building circuits on breadboards and playing with Arduinos. _<a href="/blog/2016/introducing-shift-register-my-new-electronics-blog">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/spreadsheet-thinking-vs-database-thinking">Spreadsheet Thinking vs. Database Thinking</a>
The shape of a dataset is hugely important to how well it can be handled by different software. The shape defines how it is laid out: wide as in a spreadsheet, or long as in a database table. Each has its use, but it's important to understand their differences and when each is the right choice. _<a href="/blog/2016/spreadsheet-thinking-vs-database-thinking">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-personified-user-interface-trap">The Personified User Interface Trap</a>
Personified user interfaces, like chat bots or agents, are the new thing once again. But despite advances in artificial intelligence, they still have many issues and drawbacks compared to direct-manipulation interfaces. There was a debate around these interfaces in the 1990s, and it seems to be bound to repeat itself. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-personified-user-interface-trap">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-two-paper-package">The Two-Paper Package</a>
Much of academic work is focused on writing papers. This doesn't just include the work that goes into the research and the writing, but also strategy – beyond the single paper. Here is one that worked. Even if it's a bit coincidental, I think it's a good model for other papers. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-two-paper-package">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/ye-olde-pie-chart-debate">Ye Olde Pie Chart Debate</a>
You may think that the debate over pie charts was a new one, but it has raged on for at least 100 years. Brinton started it in 1914, and great drama unfolded in the pages of the Journal of the American Statistical Association in the 1920s. _<a href="/blog/2016/ye-olde-pie-chart-debate">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/the-state-of-information-visualization-2016">The State of Information Visualization, 2016</a>
Oh hello, new year! I almost didn't see you there! Lots of interesting things happened last year: Dear Data, deceptive visualization, storytelling research, new tools and ideas, etc. And this year is already shaping up to be quite strong, too. _<a href="/blog/2016/the-state-of-information-visualization-2016">Read more…</a>_

### <a href="/blog/2016/presentation-oriented-visualization-techniques">Paper: Presentation-Oriented Visualization Techniques</a>
Presentation is often considered a part of visualization, but what does that mean for the kinds of techniques we use? Are they the same as used for analysis? What criteria should we use to pick them? In a new paper, I discuss a class of techniques I call presentation-only. _<a href="/blog/2016/presentation-oriented-visualization-techniques">Read more…</a>_
