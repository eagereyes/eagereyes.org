# Data Visualization and Journalism Event in San Francisco on September 26

Visual.ly is hosting <a href="http://blog.visual.ly/data-visualization-and-journalism/">an event on data visualization and journalism</a> on September 26 in San Francisco, under the rather clever heading of DV'n'J (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter_and_jelly_sandwich">PB&amp;J</a>). I'm one of the speakers.

<p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2617" alt="DVnJ" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dvnj.jpg" width="600" height="437" /></p>

I will be talking about my research on storytelling and where I see visualization going in journalism. Given the audience, The new Story Points feature <a title="Watch the TCC Keynote Live on Monday" href="/blog/2013/watch-tcc-keynote-live-monday">we just announced for Tableau 8.2</a> will also be part of my talk.

The other speakers are Augustin Armendariz and Michael Corey from the <a href="http://cironline.org/"><em>Center for Investigative Reporting</em></a>, as well as Aleksandra Todorova and Jess Bachmann from <a href="http://visual.ly/">Visual.ly</a>.

If you’re in San Francisco or can get there on the 26th, don’t miss this event! For more information and where to sign up, see <a href="http://blog.visual.ly/data-visualization-and-journalism/">the posting on the Visual.ly blog</a>.
