# iTunes (Music) Store Billion Downloads Visualization

On February 23rd, 2006, Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes Music Store</a> (iTMS, now called the iTunes Store) sold its one billionth song. In the days leading up that event, Apple had a countdown on its webpages, which provided interesting information about the download habits of its customers. This page provides a visualization of the collected data, as well as of data that others collected leading up to the 100 millionth and 500 millionth downloads.

## The Display

The initial view is an overview of data from the start of the iTMS in 2003 to the latest milestone of 1.5 billion songs reported on September 12, 2006. The green lines show the rate of sales, the background shows the number of songs sold. This is not very precise of course, because there are so few data points. The blue bars show you the times that more precise information is available (close to the 100, 500, and 1000 million milestones).

When you switch to the detailed view, the graph (in "iTunes green") shows the rate at which songs are sold, in songs/minute. The background pattern color changes whenever a 100,000 mark is reached (at every 100,000, they gave away something). You can see the little spikes when getting close to the 100k, and how often those 100k steps occur in times of high activity. Of course, there is also a spike at the end.

The purplish-gray area in the background shows the absolute number of songs sold. The two scales on the right give you a way of measuring the values of the rate and absolute number, respectively.

## What can be seen

There is a very apparent daily pattern. Apparently, most songs are sold in the US, the rate is highest when it is evening or night in the US. Europe and Japan seem to have little influence on that.

There is more activity on the weekends, which does not mean significantly higher sales/minute, but it is stretched out over a much longer time - practically the whole day, but with a very apparent decrease in activity in the early evening on the first sunday (in the Billion/2006 data set).

Times with more activity also show more "hunting" for prizes (spikes), and this seems to be much more prevalent in the US. The final spike was quite a bit smaller in 2006 than expected: in 2005, the final spike was around 150% higher than the highest rate in the week before, while a year later, the rate only went up by about 50%.

## Is this legal?

That is a questions I also wondered about, and so I contacted Apple. I was told that since the data "is out there", it's fair game for any kind of work like this. That is a very sensible point of view, IMHO.

## Milestones

The following list is mostly taken from Apple's 500 million downloads page (which is not online anymore), with a few additions. This is the basis for the overview in the applet.

>	Can anyone tell me where I might find Ireland-specific sales figures for iPods, iTunes, or both? The longer the time frame covered, the better, of course.  Thank you for making this site! 

Robert Kosara says…
>	<p>Apple is very secretive about sales, and only announces overall iPod sales worldwide - not even broken down by type. You might have better luck looking for industry surveys of mp3 players in general (though those might not include iPods ...).</p>

>	<p>Jobs has been around - but not that long. Thanks for pointing that out.</p>
