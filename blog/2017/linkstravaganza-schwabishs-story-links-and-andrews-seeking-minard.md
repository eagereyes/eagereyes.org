# Linkstravaganza: Schwabish's Story Links and Andrews' Seeking Minard

I don't normally do link dumps, but since I'm behind on blogging and have been meaning to link to these things for a while… here are some articles for you to check out. The first set is on what storytelling means with data, the second about an interesting discovery around Charles Minard.

## Schwabish's Sense of Story

Jon Schwabish wrote a series of postings about data storytelling that you should check out:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://policyviz.com/2017/03/20/what-is-story/">What is Story?</a> is the first posting and a bit of an introduction, with some definitions and initial thoughts.</li>
    <li><a href="https://policyviz.com/2017/03/21/story-structure/" rel="bookmark">Story Structure</a> describes a number of story templates developed by people like Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Campbell, and Robert McKee</li>
    <li><a href="https://policyviz.com/2017/03/22/applying-data-story-structure/" rel="bookmark">Applying Data to Story Structure</a> asks how data can fit into a story</li>
    <li><a href="https://policyviz.com/2017/03/23/the-storytellers/" rel="bookmark">The Storytellers</a> looks at the different people who are telling stories (with or without data): journalists, analysts, etc.</li>
    <li><a href="https://policyviz.com/2017/03/24/more-story-references-and-resources/" rel="bookmark">More Story References and Resources</a> – exactly what it says</li>
    <li>On <a href="https://policyviz.com/podcast/">his policyviz podcast</a>, Jon also devoted the month of March to storytelling, from episode 77 to 81, with episode 83 forming a bit of a coda. Even if you're not interested in the whole story thing, his podcast is well worth listening to.</li>
</ul>

I have some thoughts on storytelling coming in some future postings, so the above list is a good warm-up. I also have two papers at EuroVis on the topic, which you will be able to read about here soon as well.

Oh, and in case you didn't get the reference: you should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Smilla%27s_Feeling_for_Snow">read this book</a> (and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smilla%27s_Sense_of_Snow_(film)">watch the movie</a>)

## Seeking Minard

RJ Andrews has written two great blog posts around an interesting discovery he made. It turns out that Charles Minard was considered so important that for a period of time, his work was included in official paintings of French ministers.

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://infowetrust.com/seeking-minard/">Seeking Minard</a> is a bit of background on Minard and his famous chart of Napoleon's Russian Campaign.</li>
    <li><a href="http://infowetrust.com/finding-minard/">Finding Minard</a> describes RJ's efforts to chase down a painting that shows one of Minard's pieces in the background.</li>
</ul>

RJ has <a href="http://infowetrust.com/history/">a whole series of posts about the pre-history of visualization</a>, including a very nice poster with a timeline of some of the very early work.
