# Posters Program for Tapestry 2017

The <a href="/blog/2016/tapestry-2017-st-augustine-fl-on-march-1st">Fifth Tapestry conference for storytelling with data</a> is only about six weeks away. To make it easier for academics and students to attend, we are adding a more formal posters program this year.

We’re looking for posters about all kinds of topics around storytelling with data:

<ul>
    <li>ideas for story structures</li>
    <li>impact of stories, how to measure it, etc.</li>
    <li>case studies from work with journalists, non-profits, etc.</li>
    <li>use of different modalities like video</li>
    <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

If you’re a grad student, send us your poster! If you’re a faculty member, encourage your students to submit a poster!

## Deadline

The deadline is January 31, with notification on February 8. Poster proposals will be reviewed and you will receive a short review with your decision. We’re also going to list them on the Tapestry website, but there will be no poster proceedings. We will need your poster at the conference, though!

## How to Submit

The submission process is a bit unusual, so here are the steps:

<ul>
    <li>Find the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMo6LUyTOFnN-vLKV5iAz5JZ6PqQmEPCj28TtzF50RZ3CrXQ/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">Tapestry <em>I want to present</em> form</a></li>
    <li>Fill that out, including the abstract. This can be longer than the input field makes it look. I’d aim for 300-500 words here, more if you don’t have an image.</li>
    <li>If you have an image or existing poster design, upload that to <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2eQLo-7PRY3MDlzOC02UHJRZFk">this Google Drive folder</a>. This step is not required, but it helps us to see what you’re talking about.</li>
    <li>That’s it!</li>
</ul>

Let me know if you have any questions!
