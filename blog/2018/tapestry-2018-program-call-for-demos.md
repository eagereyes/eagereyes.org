# Tapestry 2018 Program, Call for Demos

The Tapestry 2018 program is complete, including the three keynotes and eight newly-added short stories. We are now looking for proposals for demos and will send out a call for PechaKucha-style talks to attendees soon, too.

You can find the full program on the <a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com">Tapestry website</a>. I've <a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2018/tapestry-2018-details-and-keynote-speakers">mentioned the keynotes before</a> (Mona Chalabi of the Guardian, Matthew Kay of the University of Wisconsin, and Elijah Meeks of Netflix).

We're excited to also have a great selection of awesome speakers and topics:

<ul><li>Aritra Dasgupta, <em>As you show, so shall you reap: causes and consequences of bad design in (scientific) visual communication</em></li><li>Jason Forrest, <em>The Data Visualizations of W.E.B. Du Bois</em></li><li>Kenneth Field, <em>The Cartography of Elections</em></li><li>Jonni Walker, <em>Bringing the Genome Home – Bridging the Gap between Conservation and Data Storytelling</em></li><li>Kristin Henry, <em>Storytelling with Color</em></li><li>Bill Shander, <em>WORDS > VISUALS</em> </li><li>Alex Wein, <em>Charts as Utterances</em></li><li>Nadja Popovich, <em>Personalizing Climate Change</em></li></ul>

The conference takes place November 29 and 30 at the University of Miami – so if you've been on the fence about going, now is the time <a href="https://tapestry2018.eventbrite.com/">to register</a> and book your travel!

To submit a demo proposal, use <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/oEaspM9cltYgNkpe2">this demo submission form</a>. We're still working out logistics and aren't sure how many demos we'll be able to accommodate. We should know early next week, so get your proposal in by Friday (November 9)!
