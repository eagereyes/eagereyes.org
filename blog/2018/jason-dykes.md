# Portrait: Jason Dykes

<a href="https://www.gicentre.net/jsndyks/">Jason Dykes</a> is professor at City University London, where he also co-leads the <a href="http://www.gicentre.net/">giCentre</a>. He straddles the line between cartography and visualization, publishing in both communities and combining ideas from both – which have led to crossover ideas like <a href="http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/536/">spatially-ordered treemaps</a> and <a href="http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/15119/">map lineups</a>.

Jason is also the driving force behind the <a href="https://www.gicentre.net/velo-club-de-vis">Velo Club de VIS</a>, which organizes long bike rides on the Saturday immediately following VIS. These rides are much better organized than my sloppy attempts at running groups, with fancy bike rentals and <a href="https://www.gicentre.net/velo-club-jersey/">custom jerseys</a>.
