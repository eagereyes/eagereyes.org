# A Smart Take on Election Maps

When maps are used to display data, there is often a discrepancy between the data being shown, which almost never relates to area, and the area of the different parts of the map. This is <a href="/blog/2016/all-those-misleading-election-maps">particularly common in election maps</a>. This new <a href="https://xkcd.com/1939/">map of votes in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election</a> cleverly combines geography and data in a clear and compelling way.

This map is another piece by <a href="https://xkcd.com">xkcd</a>'s Randall Munroe (also author of <a href="/blog/2015/review-munroes-thing-explainer-and-pinkers-sense-of-style"><em>Thing Explainer</em></a>). It works well for a number of reasons.

<ul>
 	<li>It doesn't distort our perception of the data by using color on area, which is determined by land surface rather than population or electoral votes.</li>
 	<li>It doesn't distort geography, like cartograms</li>
 	<li>It uses symbols of people to show a set multiple (somewhat similar to <a href="/techniques/isotype">ISOTYPE</a>)</li>
 	<li>Its hand-drawn aesthetic is fun and non-intimidating</li>
</ul>

The style of this map is not entirely new. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_distribution_map">dot density maps</a> have a long history but have fallen out of fashion over the last few decades (a colleague of mine blames GIS for this development). Here's a nice example about agriculture â€“ which you might imagine would be about area, but it's not (<a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1870">from here</a>).

Using fewer but larger symbols, it's possible to make them recognizable. There's a balance though between the size and the density that can be achieved. Munroe has done a great job in his map, showing just enough density so you can find some patterns, but not making the symbols too tiny. I also think he is trying to make a point with the single figures in Wyoming and the Dakotas (also Alaska and Hawaii).

It's a great map, and perhaps the most effective one I've seen showing this data so far, given the United States' vast area and enormous differences in population density.
