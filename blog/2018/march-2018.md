# Visualization Potpourri, March 2018

Time to wake up from the eagereyes winter hibernation with an aromatic potpourri! This time, we have news about pies, stippling, colors, sorting algorithms, and a few more. Also a video of my collaborator Noeska singing the praises of medical visualization.

Danielle Albers Szafir was named one of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/danielle-szafir/">the <em>30 under 30</em> in Science by Forbes</a>. You might remember her from <a href="https://eagereyes.org/blog/2017/ieee-vis-2017-best-papers-keynote-capstone">my VIS report last year</a> and <a href="https://eagereyes.org/portrait/danielle-albers-szafir">the portrait</a> I posted as the first (and so far only one…) in my portrait series (more portraits coming, I promise).

Pie news! Lisa Charlotte Rost has written a <a href="http://academy.datawrapper.de/article/127-what-to-consider-when-creating-a-pie-chart">nice piece about pie charts the on data wrapper blog</a>. Jon Schwabish is also starting to love pie charts, <a href="http://policyviz.com/2018/01/11/fk-it-lets-use-pie-charts/">using some colorful language</a>. Combining two of my interests, this <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/06/the-richest-1-percent-now-owns-more-of-the-countrys-wealth-than-at-any-time-in-the-past-50-years/?utm_term=.58531654de98">news piece using an ISOTYPE pie</a> is pretty interesting.

Since somebody has been sleeping at the wheel on this site, it's worthwhile to link to the tireless <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/2018/01/10-significant-visualisation-developments-july-december-2017/">Andy Kirk's most notable developments in visualization, July through December 2017</a>. Also check out <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/2017/07/10-significant-visualisation-developments-january-june-2017/">January through June</a> if you missed it.

Before handing things over to <a href="http://noeskasmit.com">Noeska Smit</a> for the items below, check out this video of her talking about how awesome medical visualization is.

Domingo Martín et al. recently released <a href="https://tobias.isenberg.cc/VideosAndDemos/Martin2017SDS">Stippleshop</a> in a collaboration between Team AVIZ–Inria-Saclay, Paris, and the Computer Graphics Group at the University of Granada, Spain. Stippleshop serves as a demo for <a href="https://tobias.isenberg.cc/personal/papers/Martin_2017_SDS.pdf">their <em>Survey of Digital Stippling</em> paper</a> and allows people to play with stippling effects on their own or provided images. In addition to the coolness of offering a small toolkit with a survey paper, I am happy to see the *shop naming tradition continue (PhotoShop, VolumeShop, RegistrationShop,...).

Morolin has made some some lovely short videos <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/GD5gi">visualizing the behavior of sorting algorithms</a>. They started out doing this <a href="https://imgur.com/a/voutF">in a rainbow colormap</a> that was burning my eyes, but redid it <a href="https://bids.github.io/colormap/">in Viridis</a> later, and the people rejoiced.

Speaking of colors, <a href="http://elijahmeeks.com/">Elijah Meeks</a> has written up some great advice for people on <a href="https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/color-advice-for-data-visualization-with-d3-js-33b5adc41c90">picking good colors for data visualization in D3</a>. The recent release of D3 v5 killed the (often wrongly used) <em>category20</em> colorscale, and Elija discusses good options for what to use instead.

>	Wow since I am here in Calgary I do feel waking up from the Winter hibernation. Nice post! Also really nice overview of medical Visualization by Noeska. Like a true fan of NPR I do enjoy the stippling shop and this survey paper. Really considering to follow the shop trend in the next years!
