# The Summer Lull is Officially Over!

This summer has been a busy one for me and a rather inactive one for EagerEyes. But it is almost over now, and even though things are not getting quieter (quite the opposite with the semester starting), this site will see regular updates (at least once a week) again.

A few articles are already in the pipeline, and I will catch up on the <a href="/influences">lists of influences</a>. Anything else you want to see – or that you don't care about?

>	I'd be interested in reading about more Infovis papers that you think are particularly important/interesting.  Perhaps you could explore some of papers from the lists of influences in more detail?  It would also be interesting to see your list of influences, and to learn more about your interests in critiquing visualisations, perhaps with some actual critiques. Stephen Few has nice critiques of commercial graphics, and it would be nice to see critiques of research graphics as well.
