# An Uncanny Resemblance

A user in a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/57580">thread on MetaFilter</a> that linked to the <a href="http://eagereyes.org/Applications/ZIPScribbleMap.html">US ZIPScribble Map</a> pointed to a drawing that has an uncanny resemblance to the map: <a href="http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=35035">Saul Steinberg's <em>Hen</em></a>. The bloggy thing of course would have been to just take the image from somewhere and put it next to the map to show it. Instead, I asked for permission. You can probably guess how well that worked.

I am not going to make this into an "information wants to be free" thing. But. I was supposed to pay a license fee (and this is, after all, an entirely non-commercial website), but what was more was that "[any] accompanying prose text or expanded caption must be submitted for The Saul Steinberg Foundation's review and approval." Somebody needs to wake up and join the 21st century, and I don't think it's me.

To end this on a positive note, <a href="http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/gemini.pl?slide=1&amp;artist=52">Steinberg's work</a> is <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/Steinberg/prints_steinberg_bio.asp">quite fascinating</a>, and I am happy to have discovered him through this.
