# List of Influences: Chaomei Chen

The second <a href="/blog/series-lists-of-influences.html">list of influences</a> is by <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~cc345/">Chaomei Chen</a>. He is an associate professor at Drexel University and the editor-in-chief of the <em><a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/ivs/index.html">Information Visualization</a></em> journal. He has also authored or co-authored six books, the most recent of which is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852337893/">Information Visualization: Beyond the Horizon</a></em>. His research interests include the visualization of social networks in general and co-citation networks in scientific publications.

Chaomei sent me not only a list, but also a very interesting introduction and comments on each of the papers. Everything below this paragraph are his words. I have added links to online versions of the papers where possible. Some of the links require access to the ACM digital library or JSTOR. The book links go to Amazon.com.

<em>This is the list of the top 10 books, papers, websites, or objects had the most influence on my work, inspired me, or made me a better person. I have a much longer list, so it is hard to come down to 10. It is even harder to put them in a single order that could adequately reflect their influence. Perhaps the most natural way is to arrange them in chronological order, but if I were forced to rank them, the first group of 5 in essence influenced me on what I would do, and the 2nd group of 5 influenced me on how I would do it.</em>

>	Hi Robert, you might want to update the link to Information Visualization as its publisher has been changed to Sage.
