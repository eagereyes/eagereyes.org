# Expressive Visualization, Updated Presidents Chart

<a href="/blog/expressive-visualization.html"><img src="/media/attachments/PresidentialDemographics.png" alt="" width="602" height="288" border="0" /></a>

I used the <a href="/Applications/PresidentialDemographics.html">Presidential Demographics</a> chart in my talk at the <a href="/blog/panel-social-data-visualization.html">Impact of Social Data Visualization</a> panel at <a href="/blog/infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses.html">InfoVis 2007</a>, and got some interesting responses to that. There is some interest in printing this out, so I have made a new version of the chart that is now also <a href="/blog/infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses.html">available as a PDF</a>. Stephen Few used Joseph Berk's term "interocular traumatic impact" – a visualization that hits you between the eyes – to describe it. And this is exactly what visualization can do extremely effectively: visual communication, and not just of data.

Visualization can tell a story, just like a comic/graphic novel or a silent movie can. Expressive visualization takes the idea of visualization as visual communication further, and uses almost exclusively visual means to make a point. And it doesn't even have to be dumbed down or prettied up for that purpose: a simple chart can be much more effective in delivering such a message.

Most of us have probably seen cases where a visualization made one point stand out, even if that may not have been the most important one. We need to learn to control the strength of a visualization, and make it work for us.

I am interested in finding more examples of visualizations that make a point – political or not. Any pointers would be appreciated.

>	I do like your term &quot;expressive&quot;, it is quite imaginative and open. 
>	We tried to coin this phenomenon as &quot;data focus&quot;, ranging from &quot;intrinsic&quot; (highlighting patterns &quot;in&quot; the data) to &quot;extrinsic&quot; (reaching &quot;outside&quot; the data, emphasizing a deeper meaning about &quot;what&quot; the data represents, sometimes even the visualization itself). So you might be interested in those visualizations on the top half of the model presented at <a href="http://people.arch.usyd.edu.au/~andrew/publications/iv07.pdf">http://people.arch.usyd.edu.au/~andrew/publications/iv07.pdf</a>.
