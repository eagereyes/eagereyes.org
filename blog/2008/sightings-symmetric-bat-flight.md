# Sightings: Symmetric Bat Flight

How do bats fly? What are the aerodynamic conditions around their wings? And how do you visualize all that? I did a <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2008/4/symmetric-bat-flight">short interview with David Laidlaw</a> (<a href="http://amsciadmin.eresources.com/libraries/documents/2008631226116815-2008-07KosaraSightings.pdf">PDF</a>), who has collaborated with physicists, biologists, fluid mechanics experts, and others, to create a poster that won last year's NSF Visualization Challenge. The interview was done for <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/"><em>American Scientist</em></a>'s <em>Sightings</em> column, which I have been invited to write.

I am taking this over from Felice Frankel, which is not an easy task. I have decided to skirt direct comparisons by changing the format and branching out into more InfoVis-y topics (though always with a scientific application), visualization criticism, etc.

American Scientist is published every other month, and I will be posting pointers to the articles here when they appear. <em>Sightings</em> is available free of charge in a web version and even as a very nice PDF (see links above).
