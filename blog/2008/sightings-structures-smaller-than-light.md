# Sightings: Structures Smaller than Light

Proteins are inherently three-dimensional, complex structures. To understand them, we need to simplify them to focus their main structural components. Jane Richardson has played a key role in the visual language that we use today when talking about proteins: ribbons and spirals. I interviewed her recently for the <em>Sightings</em> column in <em>American Scientist</em>.

If the name and work sounds familiar, you may remember her <a href="http://vis.computer.org/Vis2006/session/capstone.html">capstone talk at Vis 2006</a>. Jane Richardson is a <a href="http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/">professor at Duke University</a>, where she is now working on visualizing proteins and atom configurations in virtual environments (among many other things).

The interview is available online:<a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/structures-smaller-than-light">Structures Smaller than Light</a> (<a href="http://amsciadmin.eresources.com/libraries/documents/2008103122126984-2008-07Kosara.pdf">PDF</a>)
