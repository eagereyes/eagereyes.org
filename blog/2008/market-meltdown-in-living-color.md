Images speak louder than words. A lot louder. It would be hard to find a more vivid and impressive visualization of what happened today on the New York Stock Exchange.

If you're wondering what that little green spot is: it's Barrick Gold, with a plus of 4.53%. Good for them.

You can take a look at the mess yourself at <a href="http://smartmoney.com/map-of-the-market/">SmartMoney's Map of the Market</a>. Or if we're already back to something resembling sanity, click the thumb below for a full-sized screenshot.

Here's another one, thanks to Michael Payne for the link! <a href="http://finviz.com/">FinViz</a> looks quite interesting, though their map is a bit overloaded. Looks great, though.
