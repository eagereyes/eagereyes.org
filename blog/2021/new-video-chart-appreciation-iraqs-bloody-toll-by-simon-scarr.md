# New video: Chart Appreciation, Iraq's Bloody Toll by Simon Scarr

How do you make people not just see numbers when looking at a chart, but feel something? This chart of the number of deaths during the Iraq war has always given me a visceral response like no other, and it’s still as powerful as when it was made almost ten years ago. So I made a chart appreciation video to explain what I think is so great about it.

I’ve <a href="https://eagereyes.org/journalism/when-bars-point-down" data-type="post" data-id="8206">written about this chart and other downward-pointing bar charts before</a>, but I’ve put a lot of effort into explaining why this is such a great chart in this video. I also talk about recent (accepted but not yet technically published) <a href="https://osf.io/wj8k2/">research that shows that aligning the chart direction with the emotional valence </a>(good or bad) of the chart topic actually helps people read them.

Part of the reason for making these videos has always been that I wanted to show things the way I saw them. This piece in particular is extremely vivid to me, and I hope that my little animations bring it to life for people who might not otherwise be as impressed as I am.

I’m embedding the entire video (about 7.5 minutes) here. I don’t think my strategy of embedding the teaser worked, too many people seem to have just watched the teaser but not the full video. If you want to comment, <a href="https://youtu.be/zHfExUZKLwA">please do that over on YouTube</a>, though!

Also, if you like the video please give it a thumbs-up over there. That really helps tell YouTube that people think this video is worthwhile.

As in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW3YNLsmn8U&amp;t=2s" data-type="post">previous video</a>, there are numbered references in the video with the corresponding links in the notes below it. If you want to see more chart appreciations, I now have four that you can conveniently watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzq0eVw_4Dkqd5kuwY3uMANPvVBQ292V">in this playlist</a>.
