# Link: Maarten Lambrecht's List of 2018 Visualization Lists

I'm not generally a fan of year-end lists, but they do provide a great way to see many fantastic pieces of work in one place. And if a simple list already does that, what might a list of lists do? Check out <a href="http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/2018/12/31/the-list-of-2018-visualization-lists.html">Maarten Lambrecht's <em>List of 2018 Visualization Lists</em></a> to find out!

Maarten's list is largely focused on data visualization, including data journalism pieces from Reuters, The Guardian, the South China Morning Post, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and many more; but also postings about maps, satellite imagery, science photography, and illustration.

A lot of amazing work was created last year, it's worth spending some time to look over and get a sense of both the level and amount of good visualization work that's being produced today.
