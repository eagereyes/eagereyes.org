# eagereyesTV Episode 1: The DataSaurus, Anscombe’s Quartet, and why summary statistics need to be taken with a grain of salt

When dealing with large amounts of data, we often use summary statistics like average, median, standard deviation, sum, etc. They’re useful because they actually hide data, they reduce the amount of information we need to look at to give us a sense of the data. But the same averages and can describe datasets that look vastly different.

>	In your "show notes" on the YouTube channel, be sure to put a link back to your EagerEyes source articles. I failed to do this for years. It was only years later that I realized that while my blog gets very little traffic, some of the YouTube videos can be viewed thousands of times. Here is an article for you to consider: https://datablends.us/2019/03/06/kc-episode-24-proof-of-how-youtube-is-king/.

>	Nice video.  Heard about it in the "Data Stories" podcast.  BTW, I doubt people would watch the video in your blog and then go to youtube to click the "like" button.
