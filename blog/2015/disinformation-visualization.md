# Link: Disinformation Visualization

In his piece <em><a href="https://visualisingadvocacy.org/blog/disinformation-visualization-how-lie-datavis">Disinformation Visualization: How to lie with datavis</a>,</em> <a href="http://mushon.com/">Mushon Zer-Aviv</a> makes some interesting points about how framing the same data differently in visualization can make a big difference. Using the example of the abortion debate, he shows the usual chart tricks, cherry-picking, subsetting, etc., that is done to make the data support a particular story.

This is a slightly more opinionated view of some of the work I've mentioned recently, like <a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/research/deceptive-visualizations">Enrico Bertini's paper on deceptive visualization</a> and <a href="/blog/2015/evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts">our work on bar chart embellishments</a>.
