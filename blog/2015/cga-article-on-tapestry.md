# Link: CG&A Article on Tapestry

I've written <a href="http://online.qmags.com/CGA0315#pg14&amp;mode2">a short piece about the Tapestry conference</a> for the <em>Graphically Speaking</em> column in <em>Computer Graphics and Applications</em>. The article talks about the reasoning behind <a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com">Tapestry</a>, how it's different from academic conferences, and gives a few examples of talks. It even includes anecdotal evidence to show that the conference has enabled actual knowledge transfer.

If you <a href="/publications/Kosara-CGA-2015">prefer a PDF</a> to the e-reader version, you can find that in my publications.
