# EuroVis Running Club

I'm organizing a very informal running club at <a href="http://www.eurovis2015.it/">EuroVis</a> next week. If you're attending the conference, don't forget to bring your running shoes and leave your excuses at home.

This is even less organized than than the <a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-monday">VIS running club.</a> I'm not going to have you fill out a form. Instead, just drop me an email (rkosara at my <a href="http://tableau.com/">employer's domain</a> or use the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>) if you're interested in joining. This is just so I can send out information about the secret meeting place and time (most likely Monday morning at 7am in the conference hotel lobby).

We'll aim for about 30-40 mins, for a distance of about 5-8km (3-5mi). Pace will depend on who's there and how fast they want to go. Don't be shy about wanting to go slow, we won't be turning this into a race. The first run will be Monday, and then we'll figure out what to do from there (probably Wednesday and Friday, plus potentially something longer Friday afternoon or Saturday).

I know you're wondering: <em>what if I'm not running, will there be opportunities to experience my amazing wisdom and speaking skills?</em> I'm glad you asked.

<ul>
    <li>I will be part of the closing panel at <a href="http://www.eurorvvv.org/program/">EuroRVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV</a> Tuesday morning.</li>
    <li>I'm giving the talk for the paper <i>VIMTEX: A Visualization Interface for Multivariate, Time-Varying Geological Data Exploration</i> by Aritra Dasgupta, Robert Kosara, and Luke Gosink on Thursday morning (session FP10)</li>
    <li>I'm giving the Tableau industrial/sponsor talk on Thursday afternoon (session IND2). No, that will not be a sales pitch but there will be actual content and bad jokes. Lots of them.</li>
    <li>Finally, Drew Skau will give the talk on Wednesday morning (session FP6) on our paper with Lane Harrison, <i>An Evaluation of the Impact of Visual Embellishments in Bar Charts</i>. There will be a separate posting about this paper on Sunday.</li>
</ul>
