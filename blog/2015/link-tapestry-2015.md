# Link: Tapestry 2015

<a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com/">Tapestry 2015</a> will take place March 4 in Athens, GA. This is the third time we are holding the conference, and it is again taking place on the day before NICAR. As in the past years, have a <a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com/event">kick-ass line-up of speakers</a>. The keynotes will be given by Hannah Fairfield (NY Times), Kim Rees (Periscopic), and Michael Austin (<em>Useful Fictions</em>). We also have a great set of short stories speakers: Chad Skelton (Vancouver Sun), Ben Jones (Tableau Public), Katie Peek (Popular Science), RJ Andrews (Info We Trust), and Kennedy Elliott (Washington Post).

On the website, you can watch a brief video summary (click on <em>See what Tapestry is all about</em>) or <a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com/archive/2014">see all the talk videos from last year</a>. We have also <a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com/venue">posted information on how to get there</a>, and there will be a bus to take you to NICAR after the event.

Time is running out to <a href="http://www.tapestryconference.com/request-invitation">apply for an invitation</a> if you want to attend. Attendance is limited, and we're trying to keep the event small and focused.
