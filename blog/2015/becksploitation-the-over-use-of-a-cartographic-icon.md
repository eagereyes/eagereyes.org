# Link: Becksploitation: The Over-Use of a Cartographic Icon

The paper <a href="http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/0008704114Z.000000000150"><em>Becksploitation: The Over-Use of a Cartographic Icon</em> by Kenneth Field and William Cartwright</a> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B74oo5QGpleoVi1Ya1hTNms4REE/view?usp=sharing">free pre-print PDF</a>) in <em>The Cartographic Journal</em> describes Harry Beck's famous map of the London Underground and what makes it great. It also offers a collection of misuses of the superficial structure, and critiques them. I wish we'd had papers (and titles!) like this in visualization.

The paper is available online for free for the next twelve months, along with <a href="http://www.maneyonline.com/action/showMostReadArticles?journalCode=CAJ#97f82663-59b5-4d49-bbef-7ae8d9060d91-753f8c65-32d3-490a-a727-8e09499b383c">a selection of other <em>Editor's Choice</em> papers</a> (including <a href="http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/000870408X276594">Jack van Wijk's <em>Myriahedral Projections</em></a> paper – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMKaxQvJQp4">watch the video</a> if you haven't seen it).

Among the many interesting tidbits in the paper is this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiethemapquinn/8966983573/">clever image by Jamie Quinn</a>. The subway map to end all subway maps (other than for subways).

>	I've chased up the situation with the publisher and new Editor and at the moment my article has been switched out of the 'free to view' selection. I am sorry if this has caused inconvenience. I wasn't informed. There is a free version of the article on my personal blog at the foot of the following entry: http://cartonerd.blogspot.com/2014/12/becksploitation.html
