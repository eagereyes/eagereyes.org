description: "Wayne Lytle created this video about the Viz-O-Matic that provides lots of tools to make visualization glitzier. It's a nice little spoof, and a throwback to the computer graphics of the early 1990s (it was made for SIGGRAPH 1993). This video was brought up in a discussion about storytelling at CHI last week, though I don't think that its lessons are very deep on that subject."

Wayne Lytle created this video about the <em>Viz-O-Matic</em> that provides lots of tools to make visualization glitzier. It's a nice little spoof, and a throwback to the computer graphics of the early 1990s (it was made for SIGGRAPH 1993). This video was brought up in a discussion about storytelling at CHI last week, though I don't think that its lessons are very deep on that subject.

>	Hi! Thanks for showing us this video. For me, the lesson is that effective visualization of data  glitziness. Elements of glitz should be chosen sparingly and to enhance the visual communication of the story behind the data. I agree, it's not a very deep lesson, but it's an important one!
