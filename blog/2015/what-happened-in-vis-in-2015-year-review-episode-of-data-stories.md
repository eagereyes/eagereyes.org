# Link: What Happened in Vis in 2015? Year Review Episode of Data Stories

In time-honored tradition, Andy Kirk and I review the year in visualization on the <em>Data Stories</em> podcast. <a href="http://datastori.es/what-happened-in-vis-in-2015-year-review-with-andy-kirk-and-robert-kosara-ds65/">We chat with Enrico and Moritz</a> about blogs, projects, people, and all the other things that happened and changed (or didn't) this year.

There are lots of good links in the podcast blog posting related to the things we talk about. Though I think we were a bit too down on blogs, Andy Kirk has a good counterpoint in <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/2015/12/10-significant-visualisation-developments-july-to-december-2015/">his 6-month round-up posting</a>.
