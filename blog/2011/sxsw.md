# Vote for our SxSW Panel on Visualization!

It's that time of year again when annoying hipsters and wannabes start bugging you about their stupid SxSW panels. <a href="http://longlivedatavis.com/">The panel proposal</a> that Irene Ros has put together (and that includes yours truly) is different though, and <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11637">well worth your time to vote</a>.

## The Cast

<a href="http://blprnt.com/">Jer Thorp</a> is a data artist and designer, currently with the New York Times. <a href="http://wehavenoart.net/">Rosten Woo</a> is a designer and educator. <a href="http://unequal-design.com/">Dylan C. Lanthrop</a> is senior editor at GOOD. <a href="http://ireneros.com/">Irene Ros</a> worked on Many Eyes and Many Bills, and has spoken on many panels about visualization. And I live, breathe, eat, sleep, and bleed information visualization.

## The Panel

What's going to happen at the panel? Who knows! I'm usually the non-confrontational type, but Irene doesn't pull any punches. And the others are known to have interesting things to say about visualization as well. Between artistic visualization, data art, data visualization, visual analytics, visualization for the masses, personal data visualization, and visual storytelling, I'm sure we'll find a few things to say.

## SxSW

<a href="http://sxsw.com/">South by Southwest (SxSW)</a> is a festival for film, music, and interactive media. It attracts a lot of interesting people and has helped popularize some interesting new technologies, like Twitter.

To vote, you will have to create an account on the PanelPicker website, but it's quick and painless.
