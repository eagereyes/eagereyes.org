# Comments Closed, Switching to WordPress

After more than five years, I've finally had it with Drupal. I'm switching the site to WordPress over the holidays. If you're reading this through your feed reader, you should not notice a difference. The new site will look different and will have a few simple little features that will make it easier to browse. WordPress also is much more organized on the back-end, so I will hopefully be motivated to write more.

I have turned comments off so I can start transitioning the content. I will post more about the reasons for the switch when the new site is live early next year.
