# Upcoming Travel: SxSW and Malofiej

I will be at South-by-Southwest (SxSW) this year to speak on a panel, and also take part in the Malofiej awards and summit, where I will be a judge and speaker. Here are some pointers for those of you who might be at one (or both!) of those events.

## SxSW

The panel I am on has the straight-forward title, <em><a href="http://longlivedatavis.com/">Data Visualization is Dead, Long Live Data Visualization!</a></em> Irene Ros (a former member of IBM's VCL, incidentally) is the organizer, and it also includes <a href="http://unequal-design.com/">Dylan Lathrop</a> and <a href="http://wehavenoart.net/">Rosten Woo</a>. Between the artistic and pragmatic proponents of visualization, design, infographics, presentation, and analysis, we should have a few things to talk about.

<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP11637">It will take place on Monday, March 12, 12:30pm in Ballroom A of the Austin Convention Center</a>.

## Malofiej

Otherwise known as the <em><a href="http://www.malofiej20.com/">Pulitzer Prize of Information Graphics</a></em>, the Malofiej Awards are an exciting place for journalists, designers, and visual communicators to show their work and get recognized. There are two parts to this: the awards themselves, which are judged by an international group of practitioners and academics in a variety of fields, and the summit where a number of interesting people are going to speak. The <a href="http://www.malofiej20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/malofiej20_programa_ONLINE.pdf">program for the latter (PDF)</a> is online, and the lineup is very impressive. It includes the likes of Alberto Cairo, John Grimwade, Nigel Holmes, Simon Rogers, Andrew Vande Moere, to name just a few.

I will certainly write about my impressions and lessons learned from Malofiej, and I expect it to be extremely inspiring and thought-provoking.
