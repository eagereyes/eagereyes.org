# VisWeek Bingo!

With only just over a week left until <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/">VisWeek 2010</a>, it's time for VisWeek Bingo!

## How Does It Work?

Just like any other bingo! You attend VisWeek and mark those squares that describe what is going on. When you get five in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), you yell "VisWeek!"

Click the image below for a printable (and readable) PDF version.

Feel free to add suggestions for more Bingo squares below!

BTW, if you're on Twitter, check out the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2010/visweek/">VisWeek page on Lanyrd</a> to see who else is attending.
