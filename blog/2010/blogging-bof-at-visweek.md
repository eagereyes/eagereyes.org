# Blogging BOF at VisWeek

<a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/">Enrico Bertini</a> and I will host a Birds-of-a-Feather meeting Thursday night on <em>Blogging in Visualization</em>. We will talk about our experiences, answer questions, and hopefully dispel some myths about blogging in science. Whether you're going or not, I recommend reading the article <em><a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/57713/">You Aren’t Blogging Yet?!?</a></em> in <em>The Scientist</em>.<!--more-->

One the biggest issues, which was again raised in the Doctoral Colloquium when I mentioned blogging, is giving away too much about your research. There is no doubt that you have to be careful, but it's really not that hard to do. You can still talk about the tools you're using, papers you're reading, related thoughts, etc.

But don't let that possibility scare you away from blogging! It's easy to manage and you get a lot of benefits: becoming known in the community, promoting your work, and influencing the direction of the field more than a few papers can.

If you have more questions or doubts, come to our BOF on <em>Thursday, 7:30pm, Great Ballroom A</em> (right after the SCI Open House/Evaluation BOF).
