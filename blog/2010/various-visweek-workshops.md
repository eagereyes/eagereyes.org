# Various VisWeek Workshops

I want to call your attention to three interesting workshops that will be held at <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/">VisWeek 2010</a> in October in Salt Lake City. One is on storytelling in visualization, another on visual analytics in healthcare, and a third one on theory in infovis. The deadlines for two of them are coming up soon.<!--more-->
<h2 id="telling_stories_with_data">Telling Stories With Data</h2>
If you haven't watched the <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html">Hans Rosling video</a> yet, you probably haven't realized that visualization isn't just there for data analysis, it's also a great tool for telling stories. Also, you really need to get out from under that rock.

Anyway, the workshop <em><a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/">Telling Stories with Data</a></em> aims to bring together people who are interested in this topic, and want to discuss ideas, approaches, etc. They also have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Telling-Stories-with-Data-A-VisWeek-2010-workshop/137941022892330">facebook page</a> that you can subscribe to to get updates, even if you're only planning on attending without presenting.

The deadline for this workshop is <strong>August 4</strong>, they want a <strong>one-page abstract</strong> with bio, and you'll get <strong>20 minutes</strong> to present at the workshop.
<h2 id="visual_analytics_in_health_care">Visual Analytics in Health Care</h2>
While medical applications are huge in scientific visualization, they haven't really made their way into infovis and visual analytics. This workshop on <em><a href="http://research.ihost.com/vahc2010/">Visual Analytics in Health Care</a></em> is targeted at researchers working with medical records, on drug discovery, pandemic forecasting, etc.

The deadline is <strong>August 27</strong>, you can submit a paper with up to <strong>eight pages</strong>. Accepted submissions will be presented as <strong>posters or in oral presentations</strong>. Authors of selected papers will also be invited to submit to a special issue of the <em>Information Visualization</em> journal.
<h2 id="the_role_of_theory_in_information_visualization">The Role of Theory in Information Visualization</h2>
Last, but certainly not least, is the important topic of theory in information visualization. The workshop I am organizing together with T.J. Jankun-Kelly and Chris Weaver is titled <a href="http://eagereyes.org/infovis-theory-workshop"><em>The Role of Theory in Information Visualization</em></a>. We want to hear your thoughts on what constitutes theory in infovis, what questions we need to address, and how to do that.

We also stole the idea of setting up <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/VisWeek-2010-Workshop-The-Role-of-Theory-in-Information-Visualization/120203618025408">a facebook page</a> from the storytelling workshop. Thanks for the idea, guys!

The deadline for submissions for this workshop is <strong>August 2</strong>, with a limit of <strong>two pages</strong> for your abstract. We will select a number of submissions for <strong>three minute provocations</strong>, not full presentations. Selected authors will also be invited to submit to a special issue of a journal later.

<hr />

These are just the three workshops I know of. Feel free to post pointers to others below.
