# Parallel Sets Implemented By Third Party

<a href="http://eagereyes.org/blog/2010/parallel-sets-implemented-by-third-party"><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/media/2010/ResultBlocks.jpg" alt="" width="381" height="339" /></a>

It's nice to see an idea evolve and get picked up by other people. Which is why I'm excited to have spotted the first third-party implementation of <a href="http://eagereyes.org/parallel-sets">Parallel Sets</a> in the wild: a (Windows-only) program called <a href="http://www.knowledgeblocks.eu/kb/Default.aspx">Knowledge Blocks</a> that allows you to visually piece together a query and show the results in a table or a Parallel Sets display.

It's not interactive, but it's a start. And I like the fact that the author makes no big deal about it: it's just a Parallel Sets view after all, like a scatterplot or maybe Parallel Coordinates.

There hasn't been much activity on the Parallel Sets program recently, so I figured I'd use this opportunity to give you a little update. All versions of the program taken together have been downloaded over 1,000 times in the year or so that the program has been available. I am getting emails regularly from people either thanking me for the program (which is awesome) or reporting bugs (which is also great, because it shows that people use it). I am still surprised by the variety of uses people are finding for it: from simple categories to data flow and text mining.

I have collected a number of important issues that need to be addressed, and I also have a few ideas about new features to add (partly based on suggestions from users). Without committing to a particular date, I am hoping to get the 2.2 release out around VisWeek 2010 (i.e., end of October).

Next week, I will also be speaking on a panel at the <a href="http://nvac.pnl.gov/meeting_2010/">iVAC Consortium Meeting</a>. That panel will be about getting tools out into the hands of users, so unsurprisingly Parallel Sets will be my topic there.

Beyond the next release, I am hoping to connect the program a lot more to Parallel Coordinates, and we actually might be getting funding to do that soon. I can't talk about specifics right now, but it looks promising. So keep your fingers crossed, and I will keep you posted on any and all developments.
