# Data Stories Podcast: 2013 in Review, Outlook to 2014

The <a href="http://datastori.es/">Data Stories podcast</a> starts the new year with <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com">Andy Kirk</a> and me as guests. With the hosts, <a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com">Enrico Bertini</a> and <a href="http://stefaner.eu">Moritz Stefaner</a>, we discuss the major developments of 2013 and look ahead to what 2014 has in store.

You can <a href="http://datastori.es/ds31-year-review-w-andy-kirk-and-robert-kosara/">listen to the podcast episode</a> directly on its page, but you should really subscribe using your favorite podcast app. If you don't have one, at least subscribe to the datastori.es feed.

Andy and I are Data Stories veterans, with Andy having appeared four times now, and this being my third time (the first one was <a title="Listen To Me Dispense My Wisdom on the Data Stories Podcast!" href="/blog/2012/listen-dispense-wisdom-data-stories-podcast">a year ago</a>, and Enrico and I recorded <a href="http://datastori.es/data-stories-28-ieee-vis13-highlights-w-robert-kosara/">one episode at VIS</a>). Pros that we are, we were able to seamlessly talk over some of the glitches and lost connections. Mostly.

Many of the things we discussed are also covered in my <em><a title="The State of Information Visualization, 2014" href="/blog/2014/the-state-of-information-visualization-2014">State of Information Visualization</a></em> posting from two weeks ago. And while we were obviously discussing matters of great seriousness, there were also some lighter moments.
