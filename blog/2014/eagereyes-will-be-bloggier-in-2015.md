# eagereyes will be bloggier in 2015

I always mess with my site around the new year, and this year is no exception. In addition to a new theme, I've also been thinking about content. Here are some thoughts on what I want to do in 2015.

I don't know what it is, but I always start hating my website theme after about a year. We'll see if this one is any different. Either way, it's new. If you're curious, this is the new <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Twenty_Fifteen"><em>Twenty Fifteen</em> Theme</a> that's part of WordPress 4.1, with some minor tweaks. It's nice, simple, clean, and has a few subtle little features.

It's also decidedly a blog theme, with a focus on images. I've been using teaser images for most postings for a while now, and will make a bigger effort to find good and fitting ones. These may not even show up in your newsreader, especially for link posts (though you will see them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eagereyes.org">facebook</a> and in the <a href="http://twitter.com/eagereyes_feed">Twitter cards</a>). But they make the site a lot nicer to look at and navigate.

As for content, there are mainly two things. One is that I want to make some more use of the post formats in WordPress, in particular links. These are different in that their title link goes to the page I want to link to, rather than a posting. The text that goes with each will also be short, so you'll be able to see the entire thing on the front page. If you care to comment, you can click on the image to go to the posting page.

I already <a title="Data Stories starring Tamara Munzner" href="/blog/2014/data-stories-starring-tamara-munzner">posted the first one</a> recently, and have a few more scheduled for the coming weeks. The idea is to post a few of these a month, in addition to the regular content. If you're <a href="http://twitter.com/eagereyes">following me on Twitter</a>, it's likely that you will have seen these links there before, but there will be a tad more context here, and there won't be nearly as many.

As for the other content, my plan is to make a clearer distinction between blog postings and articles. I already have that in the way the categories are set up, but that isn't very visible. I'm aiming for more consistent posting (i.e., one posting a week, every week), with the blog postings being shorter and more informal, while the articles will be longer and more organized.

Link titles will start with "Link:" from now on, but I don't want to do that for blog postings or articles. I'm not sure yet how I will indicate the distinction, but it should at least be clear from the length and maybe the tone.

The goal is to make the content easier to consume, since I know that anything beyond a few paragraphs is much less likely to be read in its entirety (or at all). And perhaps I'll even find a use for those other post types, like <em>quote</em>, <em>image</em>, and <em>aside</em>.
