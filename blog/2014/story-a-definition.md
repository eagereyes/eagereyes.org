# Story: A Definition

What makes a story? What does a story do? In <a href="/blog/2014/stories-are-gateways-into-worlds">part one of this little series</a>, I argued that stories and worlds are not opposites, but complements. In this part, I try to explain the differences between worlds and stories, and present a definition.

## What Is a Story?

Lynn Cherny has written <a href="http://blogger.ghostweather.com/2014/03/implied-stories-and-data-vis.html">a great summary</a> of some of the research about narrative, and in particular implied stories.

I will take the two very brief stories she quotes and use them to illustrate the difference between exploring a world and telling a story. Lynn starts with the well-known “shortest story ever” by Ernest Hemingway:

>	For sale: baby shoes, never worn.

It’s powerful stuff, and you can easily make up stories. Many of them may be sad, but I can actually think of positive stories too (the parents got too many shoes at a baby shower, they bought both boys and girls shoes and are selling the ones they don’t need, okay I’ll stop now).

But the point is: this is not a story. There is no narrative, no characters, no conflict, no inciting incident, no arc, nothing. It’s not a story. It’s a situation, a vignette. It’s very evocative, and that clouds people’s judgment. But look at it again and tell me where you see the story. There is none, you get to make up your own.

Now let’s look at an actual story that isn’t much longer. It’s not as exciting, but it is a story:

Fan-fiction comes to mind as an example of exploration spurred by an already articulated story. What I see in many story maps is a tendency to just put thematically related, but disjointed pieces of data and information on a map with the expectation that the viewer finds the (a?) story. That stories are implied and discoverable apparently means that there’s no need for the story maps author to actually write the story that prompted them to make the map in the first place! This, to me, is a frustrating mindset to deal with when, regarding stories, we’re talking about something that is really central to human civilization and culture.
