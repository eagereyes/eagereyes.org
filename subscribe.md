# How to follow or subscribe

There are multiple ways to subscribe to get notified when I post new stuff here.

## Social media

The easiest way to follow this blog is to [follow me on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rkosara/) (where I only post professional news and blog updates) or [do the same on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/eagereyes.org) (where I chat a lot more).

## RSS

If you're using an RSS reader like Reeder, Feedly, or similar, use [this link](https://eagereyes.org/feed) to subscribe.

## Email

Fill in the form below to get an email when I post something new (name is optional). If you want to unsubscribe, you can just use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each email.

<div style="text-align: center" class="sender-form-field" data-sender-form-id="m0twyjsgdwp9zztl43v"></div>
