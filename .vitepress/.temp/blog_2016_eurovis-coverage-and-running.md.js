EuroVis being in the Netherlands, this will be during the day Central European Time. For people a few hours away, I will be trying a new thing: create a Twitter collection of all my tweets. I&#39;ll tweet that a few times when it&#39;s day in the U.S.</p><p>I will also write summary postings here, though I likely won&#39;t write one per day. The first one probably won&#39;t be before Wednesday, and then another one after the conference on Friday. That might change, but it won&#39;t be as up-to-the-moment as Twitter.</p><h2 id="running" tabindex="-1">Running <a class="header-anchor" href="#running" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Running&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The EuroVis and VIS &quot;running clubs&quot; have been a bit hit-and-miss, but I&#39;m not ready to give up. Bring your running shoes and <a href="/contact">drop me a note</a> if you&#39;re interested in joining. I&#39;ll figure out a good place to start from (somewhere central in Groningen). We&#39;ll probably leave at 7am (sharp!) and go for about 45-50 minutes.</p><p>The teaser image above is from Strava&#39;s running heat map for Groningen.
