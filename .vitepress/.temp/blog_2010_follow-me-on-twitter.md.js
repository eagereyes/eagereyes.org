This is a little experiment to see how many of you are on Twitter and haven&#39;t yet realized that you can follow me, too.</p><p>I tweet pointers to the stories on my website, but that&#39;s not nearly all I do on Twitter. There&#39;s personal stuff, there are links to interesting things I find, (short) rants about things that just bug me that moment, and more.</p><p>I&#39;m probably also going to stop doing my own little microblog for VisWeek this year, and instead only do Twitter. It&#39;s a lot more fun with all the other visualization folks that are there now. It&#39;s also much more useable than having to manually refresh a webpage.</p><p>And if you haven&#39;t tried Twitter, this is your chance! There are lots of interesting people to follow, like the people on my <a href="http://twitter.com/EagerEyes/visualization/members">Visualization Twitter List</a>.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? <a href="http://twitter.com/EagerEyes">Click the link!</a></p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on August 02, 2010</em></p></div>`);
