The opinions expressed here are Robert’s and nobody else’s (<a href="#legal">see more below</a>).</p><p>The original idea for the site involved the interplay of art and science in visualization. While the focus has shifted, I regularly touch upon questions of representation. In fact, I believe that visualization can be vastly improved by a better understanding issues of representation and reading of data.</p><p>Other topics of interest include visualization for the masses, open data, and where the field of visualization is heading. <a href="/criticism">Criticism</a> of visualization techniques and applications, websites, and books is also a regular feature.
