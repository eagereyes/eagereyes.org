The Joy of Plots, if you will. Also, Joy Plots.</p><p>Henrik Lindberg <a href="https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg/status/883675698300420098"> coined the term <em>Joy Plot</em> on the weekend </a>, and it‚Äôs quite clever. Not only does it describe a plot of things people enjoy, it‚Äôs also a nice reference to <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/">that <em>Joy Division</em> album cover everybody knows</a> even if they‚Äôve never heard the actual music.</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10134" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/joy-plot.jpg" alt="" width="909" height="1200"></p><p>It‚Äôs also a clever chart that shows the data quite well. There are some issues with the depth stacking that hide a few parts of the data. We‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs happening between the morning and evening peaks in <em>doing aerobics</em>, for example (fifth from the bottom). Is there a small noon bump? A few other timelines also have some parts hidden, but for the most part it‚Äôs all visible.</p><p>Is there a more ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù version? Of course there is! The offset y axes might be an issue, as is the slight angle caused by the ordering that makes it harder to see the precise times. Perhaps <a href="https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg/status/883678881366061057">a heat map</a> would work better? Or <a href="https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr/status/883753850620063744">a sort of heat map violin plot</a>?</p><p>The best solution might be <a href="https://twitter.com/xangregg/status/883763762381152256">Xan Gregg‚Äôs horizon plot redesign</a>:</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10133" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/joy-plot-horizon.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="568"></p><p>It‚Äôs not a bad chart. But it‚Äôs not nearly as interesting (despite the more exciting choice of color). The horizon chart is still harder to read than a plain old bar chart, not as interesting to look at, and it doesn‚Äôt evoke the album cover. In a word, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ <a href="https://twitter.com/xangregg/status/883843070676152320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">joyless</a>.</p><p>The point of the original wasn‚Äôt precision as much as it was just showing some data. So what if you‚Äôre missing a few minor details, you get the main ideas and the overall patterns clearly enough. Throw in a clever name and you‚Äôve got something that stands out. The horizon chart just doesn‚Äôt do that.</p><h2 id="from-bars-to-dots-and-arrows" tabindex="-1">From Bars to Dots and Arrows <a class="header-anchor" href="#from-bars-to-dots-and-arrows" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;From Bars to Dots and Arrows&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Somewhat relatedly, there‚Äôs <a href="https://twitter.com/jschwabish/status/884417924563447809">this redesign of a bar chart by Jon Schwabish</a>. The original bar chart shows the data but is hard to figure out:</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10136" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/trump-leadership.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="684"></p><p>The redesign gets to the point much more clearly and is easier to read. This may be a tiny bit less precise (and you could quibble about where the zero of that axis is), but it‚Äôs not like subtlety is important given these large differences.</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10135" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/trump-leadership-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="775" height="464"></p><p>What this chart and the Joy Plot have in common is that they‚Äôre the more uncommon charts. They‚Äôre not crazy out there, just not the first thing you‚Äôd do. But they both succeed in showing data in an interesting way, if perhaps at the expense of a small amount of precision. But what they do is present the data in a way that‚Äôs easy to grasp, which strikes me as much more important. If you‚Äôre really after precision in these charts, you‚Äôd want to have some sort of mouse-over to show you exact numbers anyway.</p><p>What they both have in common is also that they show the value and fun in exploring slightly unusual chart types for relatively mundane data. It can be a joy to plot data. Joy plotting data. Joy plots. I‚Äôll just keep saying that because it‚Äôs fun to say. Joy plots.</p><p>(Also it‚Äôs vacation time and nobody‚Äôs reading anything I write here anyway)</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on July 10, 2017</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p><a href="http://www.ii.UiB.no/vis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Helwig Hauser</a> says‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>Fishing (at the very end; for compliments, I mean), right? üòÉ<br> With success, as it seems! üòÉ Nice post with an interesting reflection: correct, but joyless -- who prefers what?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://boraberan.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bora Beran</a> says‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>Here is a Tableau version of Joy Division&#39;s Unknown Pleasures with a rotation parameter to manipulate viewing angle/depth</p><p><a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/3DChartsinTableau/VizArt-UnknownPleasures?:embed=y&amp;amp;:showVizHome=no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://public.tableau.com/views/3DChartsinTableau/VizArt-UnknownPleasures?:embed=y&amp;amp;:showVizHome=no</a></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/missleigh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Leigh Fonseca (@missleigh)</a> says‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>Robert, I like your bar chart redesign.
