Are they the same as used for analysis? What criteria should we use to pick them? In a new paper, I discuss a class of techniques I call <em>presentation-only</em>.</p><p>The paper is accordingly titled <em><a href="/publications/Kosara-CGA-2016">Presentation-Only Visualization Techniques</a></em>, and it just appeared in the <em>Visualization Viewpoints</em> column of the January/February issue of <a href="http://online.qmags.com/CGA0116?pg=86&amp;mode=2#pg82&amp;mode2"><em>IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications</em></a> (CG&amp;A).</p><p>Presentation is important because it&#39;s the kind of visualization many (or even most) people see all the time. Most people never create visualizations themselves for analysis, but they see charts, infographics, news graphics, etc.</p><p>Those are different from analytic visualizations however, and they sometimes use innovative and unusual techniques like <a href="/papers/the-connected-scatterplot-for-presenting-paired-time-series">connected scatterplots</a>, <a href="/papers/isotype-visualization">ISOTYPE</a>, <a href="/papers/evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts">embellished bar charts</a>, etc. What if those don&#39;t work in general, but do for those particular use cases?</p><p>I argue that in the presentation case, generality is not an important goal. Instead, we need to focus more on questions like memorability and engagement. That is a very different approach to thinking about and evaluating visualization techniques.</p><p>With this piece, I hope to change the way we approach the evaluation of techniques. This isn&#39;t just a small difference, but an entirely different way of thinking about what visualization does and how it should work. It&#39;s also a departure from some of the ideas we take for granted as a discipline that&#39;s rooted in computer science.</p><p>The paper is <a href="/publications/Kosara-CGA-2016">available on my website</a> and directly in <a href="http://online.qmags.com/CGA0116?pg=86&amp;mode=2#pg82&amp;mode2">the CG&amp;A e-reader</a>.</p><p>If you prefer watching a video to reading: I also used an earlier version of the same argument in my talk at <a href="http://www.isvisshenkar.org">ISVIS</a> last year. Then it was still called presentation-<em>only</em> techniques, but I softened that a bit in the meantime. Most of the examples and the overall idea are the same though.</p><p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sR5fkfbqO8w?si=AcsPCl5Whmxw-fiC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><hr><p>Robert Kosara, <a href="/publications/Kosara-CGA-2016">Presentation-Oriented Visualization Techniques</a>, <em>Computer Graphics and Applications</em>, vol. 36, vol. 1, pp. 80–85, 2016.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on January 07, 2016</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Theresa-Marie Rhyne says…</p><blockquote><p>Thanks Robert for all of your efforts in preparing this Visualization Viewpoints article.
