It lets you map data to the properties of objects like rectangles and ellipses. Build something with data, have fun, and help us figure out if it works!</p><p>This being a study, it asks you a few questions before you start, but that takes less than a minute. Then there&#39;s a brief tutorial, after which you&#39;re free to play. Build interesting things with the data (we&#39;re using the <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org">OECD Better Life Index</a> data) and submit the ones you like. This is all anonymous, obviously. My student <a href="https://twitter.com/SeeingStructure">Drew Skau</a>, who is running this study, will analyze the data to see what kinds of things you and others are building and how much of the design space you explore.</p><p>Don&#39;t forget to hit <em>Done</em> when you don&#39;t want to play any more. You then get asked a few more questions that also won&#39;t take much time, but that are crucial for the study. Once you&#39;re done with those, you can continue building or just close the window.</p><p>Here&#39;s the link to the study: <a href="http://visualizationprimitives.net">Visualization Creativity Study</a></p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on March 22, 2013</em></p></div>`);
