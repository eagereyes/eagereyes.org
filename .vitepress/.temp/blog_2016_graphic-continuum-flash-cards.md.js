They&#39;re a good way to expand your visual vocabulary and find new ideas for how to represent your data.</p><p>Each card shows one visualization technique as a stylized image on one side and a short definition on the other. They are grouped by color into six sets of related techniques, like ones used for comparing values, distributions, time, part-to-whole, etc.</p><p>The cards are a bit larger than regular playing cards, but there are 52 of them, just like in most packs of cards. There is no game component, but I&#39;m sure somebody will figure out how to turn them into a drinking game.</p><p>The cards are <a href="http://www.policyvizshop.com">available for $15</a>. If you have a Graphic Continuum poster, you can also <a href="http://policyviz.com/introducing-graphic-continuum-flash-cards/">participate in a drawing</a> to win a free set (until November 11).</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on November 09, 2016</em></p></div>`);
