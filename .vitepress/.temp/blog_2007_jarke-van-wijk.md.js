Visualization is a strongly interdisciplinary field, and with my selection I try to bring this forward. Also, this is a very personal list. I do not claim that each book mentioned is the best in its category, some of them I just ran into. But on the other hand, each of them had important lessons and insights for me. The order is more or less chronological, that is, in the order that I read them.</em></p><ul><li>N.J.M. Roozenburg and J. Eekels, <em>Product Design: Fundamentals and Methods</em>, Wiley, 1995 <em>As a student in Industrial Design, I have been brainwashed with product design methodology. Most of it is obvious, but also extremely useful and true.</em></li><li>William Newman and Robert L. Sproull, <em>Principles of Interactive Computer Graphics</em>, McGraw-Hill, 1973 <em>I learned graphics from Newman and Sproull. Compact, well-written, and now and then I still copy algorithms from it.</em></li><li>Jon Louis Bentley, <em>Writing Efficient Programs</em>, Prentice Hall, 1982 <em>Premature optimization is the root of all evil. If you understand that, then you are already halfway to becoming a productive programmer.</em></li><li>Martin M. Lipschutz, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Schaums-Outline-Differential-Geometry/dp/0070379858/">Schaum&#39;s Outline of Differential Geometry</a></em>, McGraw-Hill, 1962 <em>Math is classic, essential, and beautiful. Especially when you can use it to make interesting pictures. This book keeps on returning to my bedside table, differential geometry is very interesting and useful. And one day I hope to understand it all.</em></li><li>Ernst H. Gombrich, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Story-Art-E-H-Gombrich/dp/0714832472/">The Story of Art</a></em>, Phaidon Press, 1995 <em>Art is inspiring, and after reading this introduction, you will look at it with different eyes. The &#39;modern&#39; approach used, in the sense that the work of each artist is presented as an improvement over previous work, works very well and makes it an exciting story.
