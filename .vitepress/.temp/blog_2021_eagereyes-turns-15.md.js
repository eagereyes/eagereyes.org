Rather than look back at 15 years of visualization and blogging (though I will do a little of that too), I want to reflect a bit on what blogging means today and where things are going.</p><h2 id="blogging-is-over" tabindex="-1">Blogging Is Over <a class="header-anchor" href="#blogging-is-over" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Blogging Is Over&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It would be easy to think that blogs are old-school and nobody pays attention to them anymore. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true, but they certainly have a lot more competition today. There&#39;s the well-established social media like Facebook and Twitter, there&#39;s the newer ones like TikTok, SnapChat, Clubhouse, there&#39;s YouTube, there are podcasts, etc.</p><p>Back in 2006, when I started doing this, blogging was still a thing. People had blogs. Wikipedia still calls Twitter (which had only launched earlier in 2006!) <em>microblogging</em>. Academics had only just discovered blogging (hey, I was an academic back then!), though they still haven&#39;t really embraced it.</p><p>It seems that email newsletters are finally really happening, with tinyletter and especially Substack. But blogging hasn&#39;t really gone away. <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> is blogging, it&#39;s just a specific service. The <a href="https://nightingaledvs.com">Data Visualization Society&#39;s <em>Nightingale</em> blog</a> seems to be going well, and there are many others. The line between long-winded Twitter threads and blogs can be blurred at times.</p><h2 id="is-video-next" tabindex="-1">Is Video Next? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-video-next" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Video Next?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I used to value being able to write about data visualization and getting people interested in the more or less meta discussions about the subject. I think Moritz Stefaner made a comment once about how he hadn&#39;t thought that you could write so many words about visualization without pictures. Of course the joke&#39;s on him, because he went on to launch the <a href="http://datastori.es">Data Stories</a> <em>podcast</em> about visualization with Enrico Bertini (or maybe I&#39;m completely wrong about who said it and the joke&#39;s really on me in the end).</p><p>I launched <a href="http://youtube.com/c/eagereyes">my YouTube channel</a> a little over two years ago, and I&#39;m very actively working on more videos (the next one should land next week). While I still think that writing about visualization is important, I also think that it&#39;s silly to neglect the more visual media. It&#39;s called <em>visual</em>ization, after all. So why are there so few videos about it? And most of what exists are tutorials about how to make things in various tools. Where&#39;s the fun? Where&#39;s the visual exploration? Where are the visual explanations of visual representations?</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/LvQ-Thumbnail.jpeg" alt="Linear vs. Quadratic Change Thumbnail" class="wp-image-97150" width="660" height="372"><figcaption>One of my attempts at visually explaining visualization</figcaption></figure><p>That is what I set out to do with my videos, and I think I really hit my stride with the last couple of them. If you stopped paying attention because you didn&#39;t care to watch my face talking at you, check out <a href="/blog/2021/new-video-chart-appreciation-iraqs-bloody-toll-by-simon-scarr" data-type="post" data-id="97374">the video I made about <em>Iraq&#39;s Bloody Toll</em></a>and <a href="/eagereyestv/new-video-linear-vs-quadratic-change" data-type="post" data-id="97149">the one about linear vs. quadratic change</a> before that. This new style with all motion graphics is clearly the way to go, and I&#39;ve finally figured out how to make that work. All my future videos will be like this, no more talking head!</p><p>There&#39;s an enormous opportunity here I think, both in terms of using video as a medium for visualization (again, this seems so obvious I can barely even type it, but who does it?) and to explore what motion can do for visualization. Most people seem to have written it off based on a handful of studies, but I think those all miss the point. Motion can help people understand what&#39;s going on, there&#39;s a reason there are so many instructional videos on YouTube. We just need to figure out how to do this for visualization.</p><h2 id="how-eagereyes-has-changed" tabindex="-1">How EagerEyes Has Changed <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-eagereyes-has-changed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How EagerEyes Has Changed&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This site has changed quite a bit over the years. On <a href="/about">my About page</a>, I still maintain that it&#39;s not a blog. Of course, virtually all postings over the last couple of years have been in the blog category. And who am I kidding, this is clearly a blog.</p><p>The reason for my insistence that it&#39;s not is that I always wanted to build more tools. As I mentioned in the riveting <a href="/blog/2016/the-eagereyes-origin-story">EagerEyes Origin Story</a>, I initially wanted to build a social data visualization website, similar to <em>Many Eyes</em> (if anybody remembers that, it came and went too quickly). I did build a few, but they mostly became obsolete or stopped worked (remember Java? Yeah, I built a couple things here in Java). Perhaps the only thing that really survives, and only because I rebuilt it a couple of times, is the <a href="/zipscribble-map" data-type="page" data-id="9603">ZIPScribble Map</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eagereyes-2011.png" alt="" class="wp-image-97645" width="660" height="346"><figcaption>A snapshot of the site in 2011, shortly after the 5-year mark, courtesy of the Internet Archive</figcaption></figure><p>I won&#39;t dwell on the past here, but it&#39;s fun to look back at how dorky this thing looked a while ago. This is also the logo that was so cleverly parodied by the excellent <a href="http://eagerpies.com">eagerpies</a> website, which is online again.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/eagerpies.png" alt="" class="wp-image-97651" width="660" height="277"><figcaption>eagerpies.com</figcaption></figure><p>At the <a href="/blog/2016/blogstravaganza">10-year blogoversary</a> five years ago, I launched a big redesign of the site. That was the first time I paid for design for this site (other than buying WordPress themes for a few dollars), both to get a custom-designed logo and theme. I&#39;m still happy with the logo, but I&#39;m increasingly unhappy with the look of the site. Not sure when I&#39;ll get around to updating it, but once I do it will look more like a blog again. It also likely will be a static site rather than WordPress, but that&#39;s also one of the things slowing down progress on this project considerably.</p><h2 id="how-i-have-changed" tabindex="-1">How I Have Changed <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-i-have-changed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How I Have Changed&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One category of post here used to be making fun of bad visualizations. I haven&#39;t done this in years now, and I have no intention of doing it ever again. It was fun for a while, but it has really run its course. It just doesn&#39;t seem productive. I see people do it on Twitter, and I mostly want to defend the targets of the outrage. In fact, this might turn into a post category here once I feel like writing more again, and I did include a bit of that in my most recent videos.</p><p>Partly this change is clearly due to age, since I&#39;ve gotten 15 years older in the time this blog has been around – though <a href="https://twitter.com/EdwardTufte/status/1441003489145016320?s=20">not everybody seems to be getting mellower or wiser with age</a>. I don&#39;t intend to end up being the old man yelling at clouds. Life is too short for that.</p><p>What I want to do instead is figure out what to do here that is of value. I do think that making videos has value, even though getting people to actually watch them has been a challenge. But this isn&#39;t unlike the early days of this blog when nobody would read it. It&#39;s just not a topic people look for on YouTube. The next few videos will be on broadly interesting topics in the hope that I can get more people interested in.</p><p>Just like the frequency of posts here has slowed down, I also haven&#39;t felt the need to tweet nearly as much as I used to. I think this is again a change in what I feel is valuable, though also a reflection of how much time I spend on Twitter these days (a lot less than I used to).</p><h2 id="where-to-next" tabindex="-1">Where to Next <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-next" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to Next&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So where is this thing going? I&#39;ve been asking this question almost continuously over the years. And I still don&#39;t think I have an answer. I do have a long list of topics I want to write about, little apps I want to build, and certainly videos I want to make. It&#39;s hard to figure out where to best spend time, and the videos are a lot of work.</p><p>But this blog has been incredibly helpful to get word out about my work and that of others in the visualization research community. And I think that&#39;s a worthwhile thing to keep doing.</p><p>To another 15?</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 01, 2021</em></p></div>`);
