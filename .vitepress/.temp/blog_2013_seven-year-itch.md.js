Seven years is a long time on the web. In dog years, the site is almost fifty years old! Has it lost its edge? Have I gone soft? Where is the bite? Where is the fight?</p><h2 id="the-establishment" tabindex="-1">The Establishment <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-establishment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Establishment&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This site has become a part of the establishment. Look who&#39;s hanging out in <a title="Schloß Dagstuhl" href="/blog/2013/schloss-dagstuhl">Dagstuhl</a>, <a title="Conference Report: Tapestry 2013" href="/blog/2013/conference-report-tapestry-2013">keynoting a data storytelling conference</a>, and <a title="Glimpses of Data: The CBO’s Snapshots" href="/blog/2013/glimpses-data-cbos-snapshots">providing feedback to the Congressional Budget Office</a>. Need more proof? There&#39;s even a parody site called <em><a href="http://eagerpies.com">eagerpies</a></em>. You can’t parody something that isn&#39;t widely known, nobody would get it.</p><p align="center"><a href="http://eagerpies.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2661" alt="eagerpies" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/eagerpies1.png" width="323" height="80"></a></p><p>I have been accused of being behind that website myself, of course; sometimes in jest by friends, sometimes as an accusation by those who don’t like me. But here&#39;s the thing: I am not eagerpies, and I have no idea who runs the website. I&#39;m not that desperate.</p><p>It&#39;s nice to have my own website (and <a href="https://twitter.com/eagereyes">Twitter account of the same name</a>) to create a persona, an identity. It’s interesting to have people come up to me at conferences, saying “You’re eagereyes!” or get introduced as that when speaking at an event. But it also means that you turn soft and try to be nice. It&#39;s a trap.</p><h2 id="jumping-the-shark" tabindex="-1">Jumping the Shark <a class="header-anchor" href="#jumping-the-shark" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Jumping the Shark&quot;">​</a></h2><p>There is value in being nice. People don&#39;t want to read angry rant after angry rant. How about something that&#39;s useful for a change? A <a title="Review: Alberto Cairo, The Functional Art" href="/criticism/review-alberto-cairo-functional-art">review of an amazing book</a>, perhaps? Or some <a title="Goodbye, Academia; Hello (Again), Tableau!" href="/blog/2012/goodbye-academia-hello-again-tableau">thoughts on leaving academia</a>? Some basics on <a title="Affordances" href="/techniques/affordances">affordances</a>, <a title="Venn Diagrams" href="/techniques/venn-diagrams">Venn diagrams</a>, <a title="Data: Continuous vs. Categorical" href="/basics/data-continuous-vs-categorical">data types</a>, <a title="Aspect Ratio and Banking to 45 Degrees" href="/basics/banking-45-degrees">aspect ratios</a>, <a title="How The Rainbow Color Map Misleads" href="/basics/rainbow-color-map">color maps</a>? Perhaps <a title="The Changing Goals of Data Visualization" href="/criticism/changing-goals-data-visualization">an insight</a> or <a title="Visualization Makes Things Real" href="/blog/2013/visualization-real">two</a>?</p><p>There is no value in just pointing to things, though. There has to be more than that. The web is filled with sites that post pretty pictures, lists of stuff, and other nonsense. Adding another one to this cacophony of crap makes no sense. It has no value. It&#39;s a waste of everybody&#39;s time.</p><p>There is good stuff out there. Bryan Connor&#39;s <em><a href="http://thewhyaxis.info">The Why Axis</a></em> is a great example of thoughtful, deep analysis. Kaiser Fung&#39;s <em><a href="http://junkcharts.typepad.com">Junk Charts</a></em> is also always worth a read. And for some snark, check out the new kid on the block, <em><a href="http://wtfviz.net">WTFViz</a></em>. What is surprising (or maybe not) is how much of that is coming from outside the core visualization community, from statisticians and designers.</p><h2 id="biting-back" tabindex="-1">Biting Back <a class="header-anchor" href="#biting-back" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Biting Back&quot;">​</a></h2><p>What I have noticed in looking at some of my old postings is that my writing is less pointed and direct these days, and lacks some of the sting the earlier stuff had. I clearly need to work on my form. Knuckles must crack, blood must flow.</p><p>And it still does. People got upset by <a title="Quo Vadis, Many Eyes?" href="/criticism/quo-vadis-many-eyes">my comparison of Many Eyes and Tableau Public</a> last year. And I keep <a title="Another Look at Many Eyes, 18 Months Later" href="/criticism/many-eyes-18-months-later">scratching that wound</a>. I don&#39;t do this just to annoy people, but to point out an issue I see. One that bothers me.</p><p>Visualization is still treated like a joke by many people, including the people in the field. And with all the pretty pictures, <a title="It’s Just Too Easy" href="/criticism/its-just-too-easy">it&#39;s just too easy</a>. Which is exactly why a site like this is needed: to punch you in the face every once in a while, to shake you out of your comfy little dream world.</p><p>To make a dent, if not in the universe, then at least in the way we think about visualization.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 09, 2013</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://www.nbr-graphs.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">nbrgraphs (Naomi B. Robbins)</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>The field of data visualization includes a number of communities. Each of them would benefit from better communication with the others. I do not consider John Tukey, Bill Cleveland, Edward Tufte and many too many others to list individually to be outside the “core visualization community.”</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/thewhyaxis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bryan Connor (@thewhyaxis)</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>I love posts like these much more than angry wake up calls. I think writing directly and with a personal tone is the new edge and something I want to incorporate more into The Why Axis. Building empathy and community can be more impactful than a call to arms. Honored to be mentioned as one of the good ones out there and I love the idea of a viz blogger establishment. Blogging is a tough game so congratulations on 7 years. Just keep writing, I know I will.</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
