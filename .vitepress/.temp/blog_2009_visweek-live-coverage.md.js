Here is some information on my plans and links to what others will be doing (that I know of). Feel free to add your links, Twitter handles, etc. in the comments.</p><p>I will write short postings (which I call <em>glimpses</em>) on this site. Starting Sunday, there will be a box with the latest glimpses on the front page. There will also be a separate RSS feed for these, so they won&#39;t appear in the main site feed. Links for that will be posted once this is up.</p><p>These glimpses are meant to be extended tweets, which I find too limiting to describe what I&#39;m thinking during talks. That also gives you a chance to comment, criticize my opinions, point to more information, etc. In addition, I will also use Twitter this time around, so <a href="http://twitter.com/EagerEyes">follow me</a> if you want to get all the information. While I don&#39;t want to promise too much, I will also try to get some pictures up a bit closer to real-time than usual (i.e., not three months later). No guarantees on that, though.</p><h2 id="others" tabindex="-1">Others <a class="header-anchor" href="#others" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Others&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://cpbotha.net/">Charl Botha</a> will not only be liveblogging from this year&#39;s VisWeek next week, but also <a href="http://cpbotha.net/2009/10/05/weekly-head-voices-6-heroic-wave-brainy-mice-dont-shoot-the-messenger/">from next year&#39;s</a> at the same time – so don&#39;t get confused! Charl is also <a href="http://twitter.com/cpbotha">on Twitter</a>.</p><p><a href="http://carlosscheidegger.wordpress.com/">Carlos Scheidegger</a> has blogged about VisWeek in the past, and I&#39;m sure he will again this year. Like many other young people these days, he can also be found <a href="http://twitter.com/scheidegger">spreading his wisdom on Twitter</a>.</p><p>VisWeek also now has a <a href="http://twitter.com/visweek">Twitter account</a>, which will be fed by Carlos (and others?). There isn&#39;t anything there yet, but expect lots of activity next week (and make sure to complain to Carlos if there isn&#39;t; or if there is too much SciVis and no InfoVis).</p><h2 id="twitter-hashtag-visweek" tabindex="-1">Twitter Hashtag: #visweek <a class="header-anchor" href="#twitter-hashtag-visweek" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Twitter Hashtag: #visweek&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I suggest we all use #visweek as the hashtag to identify tweets about the conference. It is custom to add the year in conferences, but I don&#39;t see what that really adds. Each tweet already has a timestamp, anyway. And saving two digits is quite useful in the tight character budget of a tweet.</p><p>One challenge is to separate the different tracks that are happening at the same time, but that&#39;s another reason to keep the main tag short. I&#39;m not sure I want to add #infovs, #vis, #vast, etc. to every tweet;but if there&#39;s a lot going on and it&#39;s not clear from context, it&#39;s probably a good idea to do that.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 06, 2009</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://carlosscheidegger.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Carlos Scheidegger</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Given <a href="http://www.research.att.com/areas/visualization/people/">where I am now</a>, I&#39;ll personally try to balance Vis and InfoVis.
