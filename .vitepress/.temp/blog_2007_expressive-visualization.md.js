Stephen Few used Joseph Berk&#39;s term &quot;interocular traumatic impact&quot; – a visualization that hits you between the eyes – to describe it. And this is exactly what visualization can do extremely effectively: visual communication, and not just of data.</p><p>Visualization can tell a story, just like a comic/graphic novel or a silent movie can. Expressive visualization takes the idea of visualization as visual communication further, and uses almost exclusively visual means to make a point. And it doesn&#39;t even have to be dumbed down or prettied up for that purpose: a simple chart can be much more effective in delivering such a message.</p><p>Most of us have probably seen cases where a visualization made one point stand out, even if that may not have been the most important one. We need to learn to control the strength of a visualization, and make it work for us.</p><p>I am interested in finding more examples of visualizations that make a point – political or not. Any pointers would be appreciated.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on November 30, 2007</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://charts.jorgecamoes.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jorge Camoes</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>I saw these recently: <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2007/11/28/chart-of-the-day-sock-manufacturing-in-the-us">Sock manufacturing.</a><a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~cook/movabletype/archives/2007/11/when_is_a_bad_g.html">Research and Development Investments in Different Types of Energy Compared with the Cost of the War in Iraq</a></p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>Of course, how could I forget my own <a href="/Techniques/SquarePieCharts.html">Women in IT</a> square pie charts?</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>Thank you!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://infosthetics.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">infosthetics</a> says…</p><blockquote><p> I do like your term &quot;expressive&quot;, it is quite imaginative and open. We tried to coin this phenomenon as &quot;data focus&quot;, ranging from &quot;intrinsic&quot; (highlighting patterns &quot;in&quot; the data) to &quot;extrinsic&quot; (reaching &quot;outside&quot; the data, emphasizing a deeper meaning about &quot;what&quot; the data represents, sometimes even the visualization itself).
