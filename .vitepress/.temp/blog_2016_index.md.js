I haven&#39;t kept count, but I&#39;d be surprised if it was fewer than ten. So far, they have all either been off-the-shelf generic designs or ones I had created myself.

And it turns out, you can do some really interesting visualization stuff with React, once you understand the basics. In a series of very thorough postings, Jérôme Cukier takes you through the fundamentals of React and how to use it by itself or together with D3. <em><a href="/blog/2016/jerome-cukiers-series-on-visualization-with-react">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="nassi-shneiderman-diagrams" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2016/nassi-shneiderman-diagrams">Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#nassi-shneiderman-diagrams" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/nassi-shneiderman-diagrams&quot;&gt;Nassi-Shneiderman Diagrams&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Programming languages use words and symbols to represent structures like blocks and conditions.

One aspect of that is the shape of the data (long or wide); an equally important issue is whether we think of the data as a collection of rows of numbers that we can aggregate bottom-up, or as a complete dataset that we can slice top-down to ask questions. <em><a href="/blog/2016/row-level-thinking-vs-cube-thinking">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="openvis-2016-talk-videos-and-pointers" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2016/openvis-2016-talk-videos-and-pointers">OpenVis 2016 Talk Videos and Pointers</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#openvis-2016-talk-videos-and-pointers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/openvis-2016-talk-videos-and-pointers&quot;&gt;OpenVis 2016 Talk Videos and Pointers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The OpenVis Conference had another great selection of talks this year.
