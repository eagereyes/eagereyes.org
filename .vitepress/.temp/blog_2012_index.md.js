Monday (September 17) is my first day of work as a full Tableau employee. Why give up the job security of a tenured university professor for the treacherous prospects of a startup?

One that is often overlooked is the need to focus a story to just the essential points, and not overload it with unnecessary detail. Minard’s famous map is a great example of reduction to the bare minimum. <em><a href="/blog/2012/storytelling-focus">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-visweek-survival-guide-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-1">A VisWeek Survival Guide, Part 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-visweek-survival-guide-part-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-1&quot;&gt;A VisWeek Survival Guide, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>VisWeek 2012 will be held October 14 to 19 in Seattle, WA.

I have argued previously that stories do not tell themselves. Rather, we tell the stories given raw materials. Some of these materials lend themselves better to ad-hoc storytelling, so we tend to say that they actually tell the story, when it&#39;s really us who do it. <em><a href="/blog/2012/storytelling-minard-vs-nightingale">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="edward-tufte-s-one-day-course-a-review" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/edward-tufte-one-day-course">Edward Tufte&#39;s One Day Course: A Review</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#edward-tufte-s-one-day-course-a-review" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/edward-tufte-one-day-course&quot;&gt;Edward Tufte&#39;s One Day Course: A Review&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Last Monday, I got to attend Edward Tufte’s one-day course. I was looking forward to a day of interesting examples, ideas, and discussions, but was disappointed by the amount of rambling and largely historical examples, with little connection to real, current visualization (or presentation) work. <em><a href="/blog/2012/edward-tufte-one-day-course">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="cognitive-dissonance-on-the-river-tyne" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/cognitive-dissonance-river-tyne">Cognitive Dissonance on the River Tyne</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#cognitive-dissonance-on-the-river-tyne" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/cognitive-dissonance-river-tyne&quot;&gt;Cognitive Dissonance on the River Tyne&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Moritz Stefaner and Stephan Thiel have created a visualization of sensor data acquired by a floating mill on the river Tyne in Newcastle upon Tyne, Great Britain. Their choice of a flow metaphor for non-flow data creates a cognitive dissonance that makes the visualization difficult to understand. <em><a href="/blog/2012/cognitive-dissonance-river-tyne">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="data-display-vs-data-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/data-display-vs-data-visualization">Data Display vs. Data Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-display-vs-data-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/data-display-vs-data-visualization&quot;&gt;Data Display vs. Data Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Gregor Aisch recently wrote a posting about gauges, and how he finds them inspiring and beautiful in their simplicity, even though they are generally disliked in visualization. His posting highlights a common misconception about visualization, and a conflation of different uses of data display, that is worth exploring. <em><a href="/blog/2012/data-display-vs-data-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-criticism-of-visualization-criticism-criticism" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/criticism-visualization-criticism-criticism">A Criticism of Visualization Criticism Criticism</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-criticism-of-visualization-criticism-criticism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/criticism-visualization-criticism-criticism&quot;&gt;A Criticism of Visualization Criticism Criticism&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Criticism in visualization can be harsh, pedantic, and stupid. But it is also a useful tool that shows the thinking behind the seemingly simple graphical shapes we use, and teaches people things they might not be aware of. While I largely agree with Andy Kirk&#39;s criticism of visualization criticism and the danger of scaring people away from visualization, his &quot;grown-up criticism&quot; argument cuts both ways: grown-ups can argue a point without getting upset. <em><a href="/blog/2012/criticism-visualization-criticism-criticism">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="science-it-s-a-curiosity-thing" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/science-curiosity-thing">Science: It&#39;s a Curiosity Thing!</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#science-it-s-a-curiosity-thing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/science-curiosity-thing&quot;&gt;Science: It&#39;s a Curiosity Thing!&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This video called Science: It’s a Girl Thing! has been widely criticized for being sexist. What I find even more disturbing is that there is an actual need to dress science and technology up as something they are not.

Visualization tools don&#39;t have a way of assessing their output, though: were there enough pixels to represent all the data? Are there too many overlapping lines? In a paper to be presented at EuroVis next week, Aritra Dasgupta, Min Chen, and I propose a taxonomy of the different sources of uncertainty when working with parallel coordinates. <em><a href="/blog/2012/conceptualizing-visual-uncertainty-in-parallel-coordinates">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-2">A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 2</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-2&quot;&gt;A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Only a few more sleeps until EuroVis!

Very often, we essentially narrate the process of discovery, but is that really the best way? And how much data do we need to show when making a point? Just because we start out with lots of data does not mean we really need to show it all. <em><a href="/blog/2012/data-need">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="tableau-public-viz-of-the-day" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/tableau-public-day">Tableau Public Viz of the Day</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tableau-public-viz-of-the-day" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/tableau-public-day&quot;&gt;Tableau Public Viz of the Day&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There is no shortage of sites and twitter accounts that point to a new visualization every day, some even more often than that. So why start another one? Tableau&#39;s Viz of the Day is unique in that it draws from the wealth of Tableau Public, and all its picks are interactive visualizations with multiple, linked views. <em><a href="/blog/2012/tableau-public-day">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-glimpse-into-the-new-york-times-graphics-department" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/glimpse-into-new-york-times-graphics-department">A Glimpse Into the New York Times Graphics Department</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-glimpse-into-the-new-york-times-graphics-department" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/glimpse-into-new-york-times-graphics-department&quot;&gt;A Glimpse Into the New York Times Graphics Department&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>How does the New York Times Graphics Department produce the fantastic work that wins so many awards? To get a taste of the secret sauce, all you need to do is track down their Twitter accounts and blogs, where they openly share sketches and talk about process. Here is a guide. <em><a href="/blog/2012/glimpse-into-new-york-times-graphics-department">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="playable-data" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/playable-data">Playable Data</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#playable-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/playable-data&quot;&gt;Playable Data&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>How do you engage people with data? How do you make them care and pay attention and remember anything about a particular piece of data? One way is dressing the data up as an information graphic. Another might be to get people to play a little game with the data. Nick Diakopoulos and colleagues have built a fascinating research prototype of what this might look like. <em><a href="/blog/2012/playable-data">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-1">A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-1&quot;&gt;A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>EuroVis 2012 is only about six weeks away, so if you haven&#39;t booked your travel or hotel, now is the time. Here are a few pointers on where to stay, transportation options in Vienna, etc. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-1">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-explanatory-power-of-data-points" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/the-explanatory-power-of-data-points">The Explanatory Power of Data Points</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-explanatory-power-of-data-points" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/the-explanatory-power-of-data-points&quot;&gt;The Explanatory Power of Data Points&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As newspaper graphics go, scatterplots are a fairly advanced technique. They tend to show a reasonably large amount of data as single points, and they require the reader to have an idea what to look for. Most newspapers never bother using scatterplots for that reason, which is really too bad. With some explanation, a scatterplot can be a very effective means of displaying data, and in particular to allow the user to drill into the data a little bit. <em><a href="/blog/2012/the-explanatory-power-of-data-points">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visual-ly-create" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visually-create">Visual.ly Create</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visual-ly-create" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visually-create&quot;&gt;Visual.ly Create&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Information graphics are a big and growing business, but the tools that are used for making them are little better than paper and pencil. That is particularly problematic when it comes to infographics that are heavy on data, which not only require a lot of work, but also many repeating steps that could be handled by a machine. Visual.ly&#39;s recently launched Create tool takes care of some of this work to create better and more flexible information graphics. <em><a href="/blog/2012/visually-create">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="april-is-visualization-challenge-time" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/april-visualization-challenge-time">April is Visualization Challenge Time!</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#april-is-visualization-challenge-time" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/april-visualization-challenge-time&quot;&gt;April is Visualization Challenge Time!&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While there has been some criticism of a particular type of visualization challenge recently, there are many other challenges that are organized well and provide good opportunities for people to work on their skills. Two challenges in particular have caught my attention, and are presented here with the official EagerEyes Quality Seal and Stamp of Approval. <em><a href="/blog/2012/april-visualization-challenge-time">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="what-does-it-mean-to-inform" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/what-does-it-mean-to-inform">What Does It Mean to Inform?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-it-mean-to-inform" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/what-does-it-mean-to-inform&quot;&gt;What Does It Mean to Inform?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Information graphics are meant to carry meaning, so that readers can learn something about data, facts, or processes. But what does it mean to inform? And how does the goal of informing in information graphics differ from analytical visualization? <em><a href="/blog/2012/what-does-it-mean-to-inform">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="malofiej-20" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/malofiej-20">Malofiej 20</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#malofiej-20" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/malofiej-20&quot;&gt;Malofiej 20&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Malofiej was an exhausting week with many great conversations, fascinating insights, and great company. My sleep-deprived and jet-lagged brain is buzzing with things to write about, and this is only the first of several articles about or inspired by Malofiej. I start with a discussion on why I think The New York Times did so well this year, and what other newspapers can do to catch up. <em><a href="/blog/2012/malofiej-20">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="upcoming-travel-sxsw-and-malofiej" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/upcoming-travel-sxsw-malofiej">Upcoming Travel: SxSW and Malofiej</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#upcoming-travel-sxsw-and-malofiej" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/upcoming-travel-sxsw-malofiej&quot;&gt;Upcoming Travel: SxSW and Malofiej&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I will be at South-by-Southwest (SxSW) this year to speak on a panel, and also take part in the Malofiej awards and summit, where I will be a judge and speaker.

By clicking on the following link, you will be taken to one of several slightly different versions of a visual story about the development of the gross domestic product (GDP) in different countries. Watch it, play with it, and if you like it: share it. You will help us understand which types of storytelling work and which don&#39;t.

Fadeyev talks about the Victorian obsession with ornamentation, but he could equally be talking about the way charts and infographics are often decorated. A short excursion to the 1850s might help shed some light on the issue of chart junk. <em><a href="/blog/2012/three-types-chart-junk">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-bikini-chart" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/bikini-chart">The Bikini Chart</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-bikini-chart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/bikini-chart&quot;&gt;The Bikini Chart&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Obama administration released a chart a while ago that shows job losses during the last year of the Bush administration and the first year after Obama took office. The chart is simple yet effective in the way it communicates a message. It also has some very subtle design elements that communicate a much more negative undertone than is immediately obvious. <em><a href="/blog/2012/bikini-chart">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="quo-vadis-many-eyes" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/quo-vadis-many-eyes">Quo Vadis, Many Eyes?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#quo-vadis-many-eyes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/quo-vadis-many-eyes&quot;&gt;Quo Vadis, Many Eyes?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Remember when visualization for the masses was all the rage, back in 2007? We were so young and hopeful. Many Eyes and Swivel were the harbingers of a new age of data literacy and well-informed debate. Visualization was going to be social and change the world. Alas, it was not to last. Swivel is gone, and Many Eyes clearly seen its best days. This is despite the fact that interest in visualization is growing, and it turns out that Many Eyes is as busy now as never before. I have scraped some data from the site that shows that despite the lack of updates and new features, people&#39;s use of it is still increasing. The data also gives some interesting insights into what people use it for. <em><a href="/blog/2012/quo-vadis-many-eyes">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="another-metaphor-for-visualization-writing" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/metaphor-visualization-writing">Another Metaphor for Visualization: Writing</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#another-metaphor-for-visualization-writing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/metaphor-visualization-writing&quot;&gt;Another Metaphor for Visualization: Writing&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Andrew Gelman recently wrote a blog posting in which he draws an interesting comparison between writing styles and graphics styles. I think he&#39;s on to something, and the comparison can be taken a bit further to illustrate some common misunderstandings around visualization. <em><a href="/blog/2012/metaphor-visualization-writing">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="watchlist-jessica-hullman" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/jessica-hullman">Watchlist: Jessica Hullman</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#watchlist-jessica-hullman" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/jessica-hullman&quot;&gt;Watchlist: Jessica Hullman&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Among the papers that stood out at InfoVis 2011 were two that shared an author, and that were presented in the same session by the same person: Jessica Hullman. These papers were Benefitting InfoVis with Visual Difficulties (with Eytan Adar and Priti Shah) and Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization (with Nicholas Diakopoulos). <em><a href="/blog/2012/jessica-hullman">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="graphs-beyond-the-hairball" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/graphs-hairball">Graphs Beyond the Hairball</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#graphs-beyond-the-hairball" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/graphs-hairball&quot;&gt;Graphs Beyond the Hairball&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Networks are usually drawn using a technique called node-link diagrams. While that works well for small graphs (the technical name for networks), it breaks down beyond a few dozen nodes. Better techniques exist, though these are currently focused on specific types of graphs or answer particular questions. <em><a href="/blog/2012/graphs-hairball">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="venn-diagrams" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/venn-diagrams">Venn Diagrams</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#venn-diagrams" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/venn-diagrams&quot;&gt;Venn Diagrams&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Venn diagrams are a great way to visualize the structure of set relationships. They&#39;re also an example of a technique that works very well for a particular purpose, but that entirely fails outside its well-defined scope or when the number of sets gets too large. <em><a href="/blog/2012/venn-diagrams">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="where-infographics-are-going" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/where-infographics-are-going">Where Infographics Are Going</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-infographics-are-going" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/where-infographics-are-going&quot;&gt;Where Infographics Are Going&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At their best, information graphics can be informative, exciting, and attractive. At their worst, they can be misleading, overdesigned, and empty. Infographics are still in their infancy, with a lot of untapped potential.

The topics I will be working on include storytelling and Tableau Public, plus some super-secret projects even I don&#39;t know yet (mostly because we haven&#39;t decided on them). <em><a href="/blog/2012/hello-tableau-and-seattle">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="an-interactive-version-of-the-zipscribble-map" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/interactive-version-zipscribble-map">An Interactive Version of the ZIPScribble Map</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#an-interactive-version-of-the-zipscribble-map" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/interactive-version-zipscribble-map&quot;&gt;An Interactive Version of the ZIPScribble Map&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For more than five years, the ZIPScribble Map and its related pages have been the most popular feature on my website.

The most common pitch two candidates against each other, and often make a big deal out of the fact that the lines cross. Not only are these charts misleading in the way they depict the choice, they also hide an important fact: the number of undecided voters. <em><a href="/blog/2012/embracing-uncertainty-two-line-charts">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="new-posting-frequency-for-2012" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/posting-frequency-2012">New Posting Frequency for 2012</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-posting-frequency-for-2012" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/posting-frequency-2012&quot;&gt;New Posting Frequency for 2012&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In my enthusiasm about switching to WordPress, I made the mistake of tweeting about potentially increasing my posting frequency in 2012. While I have tried to stick to a roughly weekly schedule in the past, there have been weeks when I did not write anything. My hope is to increase the frequency to roughly twice a week and see how that goes.
