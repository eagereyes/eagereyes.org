Here are some of my thoughts, but more than that I want to see if anybody has more idea, and maybe even a bit of evidence, on why ISOTYPE fell out of fashion in the 1950s and hasn’t really come back since. <em><a href="/blog/2020/what-happened-to-isotype">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="isotype-book-young-prager-there-s-work-for-all" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2019/isotype-book-young-prager-theres-work-for-all">ISOTYPE Book: Young, Prager, There’s Work for All</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#isotype-book-young-prager-there-s-work-for-all" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/isotype-book-young-prager-theres-work-for-all&quot;&gt;ISOTYPE Book: Young, Prager, There’s Work for All&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This book from 1945 contains a very interesting mix of different charts made by the ISOTYPE Institute, some classic and some quite unusual. As a book about labor and unemployment, it also makes extensive use of Gerd Arntz’s famous unemployed man icon. <em><a href="/blog/2019/isotype-book-young-prager-theres-work-for-all">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="eagereyestv-episode-2-unit-charts-dot-plots-isotype-and-what-makes-them-special" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2019/eagereyestv-episode-2-unit-charts-dot-plots-and-isotype-and-what-makes-them-special">eagereyesTV Episode 2: Unit Charts, Dot Plots, ISOTYPE, and What Makes Them Special</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#eagereyestv-episode-2-unit-charts-dot-plots-isotype-and-what-makes-them-special" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/eagereyestv-episode-2-unit-charts-dot-plots-and-isotype-and-what-makes-them-special&quot;&gt;eagereyesTV Episode 2: Unit Charts, Dot Plots, ISOTYPE, and What Makes Them Special&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Charts usually show values as visual properties, like the length in a bar chart, the location in a scatterplot, the area in a bubble chart, etc. Unit charts show values as multiples instead. One famous example of these charts is called ISOTYPE, and you may have seen them in information graphics as well. They’re an interesting family of charts and they seem to have some unusual properties that most other charts don’t have. <em><a href="/blog/2019/eagereyestv-episode-2-unit-charts-dot-plots-and-isotype-and-what-makes-them-special">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="isotype-book-florence-only-an-ocean-between" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/isotype-book-florence-only-an-ocean-between">ISOTYPE Book: Florence, Only An Ocean Between</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#isotype-book-florence-only-an-ocean-between" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/isotype-book-florence-only-an-ocean-between&quot;&gt;ISOTYPE Book: Florence, Only An Ocean Between&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The book Only An Ocean Between by Lella Secor Florence contains some of the most iconic ISOTYPE charts. It was published in 1943, as part of a small series called America and Britain. <em><a href="/blog/2017/isotype-book-florence-only-an-ocean-between">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="isotype-book-priestley-british-women-go-to-war" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/isotype-book-priestley-british-women-go-to-war">ISOTYPE Book: Priestley, British Women Go To War</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#isotype-book-priestley-british-women-go-to-war" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/isotype-book-priestley-british-women-go-to-war&quot;&gt;ISOTYPE Book: Priestley, British Women Go To War&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is perhaps the oddest book with an ISOTYPE illustration, certainly of the ones I have seen so far. It also contains the most confusing chart produced by the ISOTYPE Institute I am aware of. <em><a href="/blog/2017/isotype-book-priestley-british-women-go-to-war">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="isotype-book-mackenzie-the-vital-flame" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/mackenzie-the-vital-flame">ISOTYPE Book: Mackenzie, The Vital Flame</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#isotype-book-mackenzie-the-vital-flame" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/mackenzie-the-vital-flame&quot;&gt;ISOTYPE Book: Mackenzie, The Vital Flame&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The first book in the new series on ISOTYPE books is The Vital Flame by Compton Mackenzie, published by The British Gas Council in 1947. It contains 42 color photographs and five ISOTYPE charts, with a nice variety of different topics and styles. <em><a href="/blog/2017/mackenzie-the-vital-flame">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="new-series-isotype-books" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/intro">New Series: ISOTYPE Books</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-series-isotype-books" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/intro&quot;&gt;New Series: ISOTYPE Books&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Presenting facts through data is not a recent idea. Otto and Marie Neurath created ISOTYPE in the 1920s and then ran their ISOTYPE Institute for more than two decades. During that time, they created charts for a wide variety of publications. In this series, I will show a number of these charts that I have found, and discuss the context they appeared in. <em><a href="/blog/2017/intro">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2016/the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization">The Repetitive and Boring History of Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization&quot;&gt;The Repetitive and Boring History of Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When people talk about the history of data visualization, the same set of names always comes up: Playfair, Nightingale, Snow, Minard. They are historically important, alright, but why do they overshadow all the other work that was done? And what do we know about how important they actually were? <em><a href="/blog/2016/the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="paper-isotype-visualization-–-working-memory-performance-and-engagement-with-pictographs" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/isotype-visualization">Paper: ISOTYPE Visualization – Working Memory, Performance, and Engagement with Pictographs</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#paper-isotype-visualization-–-working-memory-performance-and-engagement-with-pictographs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/isotype-visualization&quot;&gt;Paper: ISOTYPE Visualization – Working Memory, Performance, and Engagement with Pictographs&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Unit charts are not common in visualization, and they are often considered a bad idea. The same is true for using shapes other than rectangles. Neither is based on much actual research, however. In a new paper, we look at the specific example of ISOTYPE-style charts – and find them to be quite effective. <em><a href="/blog/2015/isotype-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="seminal-infovis-paper-treisman-preattentive-processing" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/treisman-preattentive-processing">Seminal InfoVis Paper: Treisman, Preattentive Processing</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#seminal-infovis-paper-treisman-preattentive-processing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/treisman-preattentive-processing&quot;&gt;Seminal InfoVis Paper: Treisman, Preattentive Processing&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A paper on a specific cognitive mechanism may seems like an odd choice as the first paper in this series, but it is the one that sparked the idea for it. It is also the one that has its 30th birthday this year, having been published in August 1985. And it is an important paper, and could play an even bigger role in visualization if properly understood and used. <em><a href="/blog/2015/treisman-preattentive-processing">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-isotype" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/isotype">The ISOTYPE</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-isotype" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/isotype&quot;&gt;The ISOTYPE&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Communicating data visually is not only about perception and precision, but also understanding. ISOTYPE was developed to bridge the gap between showing data in a way that&#39;s easy to read and at the same time easier to understand than unadorned bar charts. <em><a href="/blog/2013/isotype">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
