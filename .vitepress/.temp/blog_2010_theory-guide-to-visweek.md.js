You can get through almost the entire conference purely on theory papers. Whether that&#39;s a good idea is another question of course, but here&#39;s a guide how to do it.</p><h2 id="sunday" tabindex="-1">Sunday <a class="header-anchor" href="#sunday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sunday&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Start your week of with some color theory in the tutorial <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/tutorials.html#Applying%20Color%20Theory%20to%20Visualization" target="_blank">Applying Color Theory to Visualization</a></em>, held Sunday morning by Teresa-Marie Rhyne.</p><p>And if you think that statistics qualifies as visualization theory (hey, it might!), you could do worse than Hadley Wickham&#39;s tutorial on <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/tutorials.html#Visualizing%20Data%20in%20R" target="_blank">Visualizing Data in R</a></em> in the afternoon session.</p><p>There will also be some theory topics in the doctoral colloquium, but since that&#39;s only open for participants, you likely won&#39;t get a chance to see that. But just so you know.</p><h2 id="monday" tabindex="-1">Monday <a class="header-anchor" href="#monday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Monday&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Things get serious on Monday morning with the workshop <em><a href="/infovis-theory-workshop">The Role of Theory in Information Visualization</a></em>. If you care about theory at all, you can&#39;t miss that one.</p><p>Monday afternoon is a bit of a theory desert, but Chris Weaver&#39;s paper in the <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/vast/sessions_papers.html#Space,%20Time,%20and%20Multivariate%20Analytics" target="_blank">first afternoon session of VAST</a></em> promises to be interesting — as do some of the other papers, so I&#39;d suggest to stick with VAST on Monday afternoon.</p><h2 id="tuesday" tabindex="-1">Tuesday <a class="header-anchor" href="#tuesday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tuesday&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Tuesday is one of those &quot;it&#39;s darkest just before dawn&quot; days. The workshop on <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/workshops.html#Telling%20Stories%20with%20Data" target="_blank">Telling Stories with Data</a></em> promises to be interesting though, and features <a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/" target="_blank">some top-notch speakers</a>.</p><p>But! There&#39;s also the VisLies session Tuesday night after the SCI open house (8:30-10pm, Imperial Ballroom CD). This year, it&#39;s not only about making fun of terrible decisions made by people who should know better, but also to figure out what we can learn from them.</p><h2 id="wednesday" tabindex="-1">Wednesday <a class="header-anchor" href="#wednesday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wednesday&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Once you get to Wednesday, you&#39;re good for the rest of the week. Wednesday starts off with the <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/keynote.html" target="_blank">VisWeek keynote by Mary Hegarty</a>, who will talk about the relationship between cognitive science and visualization.</p><p>Right after that, the first session in Vis is on <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/vis/sessions_papers.html#Theoretical%20Foundations%20of%20Visualization" target="_blank">Theoretical Foundations of Visualization</a></em>, and features some really good papers that are not only relevant if you&#39;re in SciVis.</p><p>In the afternoon, don&#39;t miss the InfoVis session on <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/infovis/sessions_papers.html#Evaluation" target="_blank">Evaluation</a>, to apply what you learned in the keynote in the morning.</p><p>To get a bit of variety into this day, you might want to then switch to the vis track for the weirdly short <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/vis/sessions_contest.html" target="_blank">Vis contest</a> session and the <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/discovery.html" target="_blank">Discovery Exhibition</a> right after that. Round the day off with some posters and a lot of food (the banquet!), and you&#39;re ready for …</p><h2 id="thursday" tabindex="-1">Thursday <a class="header-anchor" href="#thursday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Thursday&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Okay, I might be biased here. But the two sessions you absolutely have to attend in the morning are <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/infovis/sessions_papers.html#Perception%20and%20Cognition" target="_blank">Perception and Cognition</a></em> (featuring our <a href="/papers/2010/laws-of-attraction">paper on the laws of attraction</a>) and then <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/infovis/sessions_papers.html#Multi-dimensional%20Visualization" target="_blank">Multi-dimensional Visualizaton</a></em> (to learn <a href="/papers/2010/pargnostics">everything about Pargnostics</a>).</p><p>The first afternoon session on <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/infovis/sessions_papers.html#Graph%20Visualization" target="_blank">Graph Visualization</a></em> should be theoretical enough for most tastes.</p><p>The second one starts out with a <em>Salute to Jacques Bertin</em>, and then continues with <a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/infovis/sessions_papers.html#Social%20Applications" target="_blank">Social Applications</a>. The latter may not be all that theoretical, but remember what we said about variety being the spice of life above? Exactly.</p><p>At the same time as the SCI Open House on Thursday, there is a BOF on evaluation titled <em>Getting to &quot;a-HA!&quot; — and Knowing How We Got There: A Birds-of-a-Feather Meeting for Visualization Evaluation</em>, which will include discussion about how evaluation relates to theory.</p><h2 id="friday" tabindex="-1">Friday <a class="header-anchor" href="#friday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Friday&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Yes, it&#39;s the last day and you&#39;re all hung over, but if you don&#39;t drag your weary behind to the panel on <em><a href="http://vis.computer.org/VisWeek2010/session/panels.html#Visualization%20Theory" target="_blank">Visualization Theory: Putting the Pieces Together</a></em>, you&#39;ll be sorry later. You can sleep during the capstone (no, don&#39;t do that! that&#39;s rude!).</p><p>And that&#39;s it: An entire week of (almost) non-stop theory papers at VisWeek!</p><hr><p>Since I&#39;m running out of clever pictures about theory, the above is a <a href="http://www.wordle.net/" target="_blank">Wordle</a> of all the Vis, InfoVis, and VAST paper and poster titles and authors for 2010. Draw your own conclusions from it.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 23, 2010</em></p></div>`);
