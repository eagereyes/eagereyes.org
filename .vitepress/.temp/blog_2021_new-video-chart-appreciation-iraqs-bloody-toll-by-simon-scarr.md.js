I also talk about recent (accepted but not yet technically published) <a href="https://osf.io/wj8k2/">research that shows that aligning the chart direction with the emotional valence </a>(good or bad) of the chart topic actually helps people read them.</p><p>Part of the reason for making these videos has always been that I wanted to show things the way I saw them. This piece in particular is extremely vivid to me, and I hope that my little animations bring it to life for people who might not otherwise be as impressed as I am.</p><p>I’m embedding the entire video (about 7.5 minutes) here. I don’t think my strategy of embedding the teaser worked, too many people seem to have just watched the teaser but not the full video.
