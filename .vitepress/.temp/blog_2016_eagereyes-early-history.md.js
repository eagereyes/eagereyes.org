Some of those postings were terrible, some of them were quite prescient or are even still popular.</p><p>This is partly why I created the <a href="/blog-calendar">interactive posting calendar</a>. It makes it easy browse postings just by mousing over, especially those early ones (clicking opens them in a new tab).</p><h2 id="the-first-posting" tabindex="-1">The First Posting! <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-first-posting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The First Posting!&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="/blog/2006/taking-visualization-to-the-next-level">In my first posting ever</a>, I immediately started bitching about the lack of theoretical foundations:</p><blockquote><p>But in many ways, visualization is today mostly technical, empirical, and there is practically no theoretical foundation for what we are doing.</p></blockquote><p>The writing in that posting is a bit tortured and it&#39;s no wonder nobody read it at the time. But I still believe all the things I talk about there, so that&#39;s not bad.</p><h2 id="more-early-postings" tabindex="-1">More Early Postings <a class="header-anchor" href="#more-early-postings" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;More Early Postings&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Things happened quickly in those early days! I didn&#39;t realize that within a few weeks, I had written a number of postings:</p><ul><li><a href="/applications/itunes-billion-song-downloads"><em>iTunes (Music) Store Billion Downloads Visualization</em></a>. The iTunes Store had just been renamed from iTunes <em>Music</em> Store (this was before the iPhone had even been announced!) and I was able to capture the data that was feeding a countdown counter on Apple&#39;s website. Sadly, I created the visualization in Java, which most people no longer have (and I also broke something with the embedding). I might build a web version of this at some point. This was my second posting ever though, kind of mind-blowing.</li><li><em><a href="/blog/2006/opining-or-murmuring">Opining or Murmuring: Infographics vs. Visualization</a></em>. Infographics and their relationship to visualization has been a recurring theme here. This very early posting linked to a piece by Kaiser Fung. When you look at the comments there, I thought his observation was really interesting. My posting probably came after that. Who says comments are useless?</li><li>Criticism was a topic from the very beginning. Among the first few postings I&#39;m finding <em><a href="/criticism/visualization-criticism">Visualization Criticism – A New Way of Thinking about Visualization</a></em> and <em><a href="/blog/2006/loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic">The Loneliness of the Visualization Critic</a></em> (title inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loneliness_of_the_Long-Distance_Runner">this great short story</a> I had read as a teenager).</li><li><a href="/criticism/informative-art"><em>When Informative Art Isn&#39;t</em></a>. Yeah, I was never afraid to pick fights. I criticized two related papers about a particular kind of ambient display. Lars Erik Holmquist, one of the authors of those papers, responded and it turned into a good discussion (we also later <a href="/papers/vis-criticism">wrote a paper together</a>, where we used this as an example).</li><li><a href="/techniques/sets-of-possible-occurrences"><em>Sets of Possible Occurrences</em></a>. The first technique posting of sorts. SOPOs (as they&#39;re affectionately called) are an interesting theoretical idea, but a complete failure as a visualization.</li><li><a href="/zipscribble-maps/united-states"><em>The US ZIPScribble Map</em></a>. Posted December 1, 2006, this became the first really popular posting on this site. So popular in fact, that fights broke out in the comments and I had to delete some comments to stop the nonsense. This is still the longest comment thread on this site, I believe. The ZIPScribble Map is now interactive, includes many more countries, <a href="/zipscribble-map">and lives here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="the-first-comment" tabindex="-1">The First Comment! <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-first-comment" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The First Comment!&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Want to guess who left the first comment on eagereyes? Well, I&#39;ll tell you: it was Hadley Wickham! He argued with me in the comment section of <a href="/techniques/square-pie-charts">this article about square pie charts</a> that they&#39;re really the same thing as treemaps. Some of the earlier postings have comments, but those actually came later.</p><p>I have a posting for later this week that will look at the time before October 1, 2006 – those days before, um, recorded history.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on September 26, 2016</em></p></div>`);
