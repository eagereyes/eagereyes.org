We know how to encode specific types of data, what visual encodings work well, and what does not work so well. But is there such a thing as a perfect visualization for a given set of data? <em><a href="/blog/2013/perfect-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-golden-age-of-information-graphics" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/golden-age-information-graphics">The Golden Age of Information Graphics</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-golden-age-of-information-graphics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/golden-age-information-graphics&quot;&gt;The Golden Age of Information Graphics&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Infographics today are mostly pointless decorations around a few simple facts that add nothing meaningful.

Unemployment rates, housing prices, crime, etc. are all boiled down to single numbers that average over a large population. But averages, or means, hide much of the richness of the underlying data, and without at least a sense of the spread of the data values, are largely meaningless. <em><a href="/blog/2013/means">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-most-iconic-visualizations" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/iconic-visualizations">The Most Iconic Visualizations</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-most-iconic-visualizations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/iconic-visualizations&quot;&gt;The Most Iconic Visualizations&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I was asked about the most iconic data graphics in the last ten years for an article on FastCoLabs last week (so were Andy Kirk and Matt Stiles). It&#39;s an interesting question not only because of the actual choices, but also the criteria to use. Is something iconic because of its unique look and/or shape? Does it have to have impact?

What makes it stand out from other web-based visualization tools is its focus on particular data, and the ability to create not just individual views, but little stories. <em><a href="/blog/2013/ged-viz-data-storytelling-tool">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="it-s-just-too-easy" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/its-just-too-easy">It&#39;s Just Too Easy</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#it-s-just-too-easy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/its-just-too-easy&quot;&gt;It&#39;s Just Too Easy&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Once you’ve seen one visualization book, you’ve seen them all.

Here is a more reasonable definition of chart junk that does away with the pretense of a mathematical formula and puts some common sense back into the question of good chart design. <em><a href="/blog/2013/definition-chart-junk">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="tableau-desktop-now-free-for-university-students" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/tableau-desktop-free-university-students">Tableau Desktop Now Free For University Students</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tableau-desktop-now-free-for-university-students" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/tableau-desktop-free-university-students&quot;&gt;Tableau Desktop Now Free For University Students&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you are a student at a university, you can now get a free license for the full version of Tableau Desktop. No matter if you use it in class or for research, this is the full version that does not restrict the amount of data or the kind of connectivity (like Tableau Public does). The license is good for one year and can be renewed as long as you are enrolled at university. <em><a href="/blog/2013/tableau-desktop-free-university-students">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visualization-makes-things-real" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/visualization-real">Visualization Makes Things Real</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visualization-makes-things-real" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/visualization-real&quot;&gt;Visualization Makes Things Real&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Vision is the sense we most identify with: it tells us where we are, who we are talking to, what we are doing. It defines our world like no other sense. What we can see is real, for better or worse. <em><a href="/blog/2013/visualization-real">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="data-storytelling-in-video" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/data-storytelling-video">Data Storytelling in Video</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-storytelling-in-video" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/data-storytelling-video&quot;&gt;Data Storytelling in Video&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I&#39;m not a fan of video. I don&#39;t spend time randomly surfing YouTube, and when given the choice between reading an article and watching a video, I&#39;ll read. The reason is that videos often don&#39;t work well for me: they&#39;re too fast or too slow, they take a long time to get to the point, they don&#39;t let me skip around and browse easily. I&#39;d rather be in control than having the information pre-packaged for me. But two examples have surfaced in the last few days that show data visualization can tell a very effective story in well-designed, well-paced videos. <em><a href="/blog/2013/data-storytelling-video">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-isotype" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/isotype">The ISOTYPE</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-isotype" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/isotype&quot;&gt;The ISOTYPE&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Communicating data visually is not only about perception and precision, but also understanding. ISOTYPE was developed to bridge the gap between showing data in a way that&#39;s easy to read and at the same time easier to understand than unadorned bar charts. <em><a href="/blog/2013/isotype">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-halfway-house-to-nowhere" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/halfway-house">The Halfway House To Nowhere</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-halfway-house-to-nowhere" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/halfway-house&quot;&gt;The Halfway House To Nowhere&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>What is visualization for? Is it a tool help us understand data and the world, and to make better decisions because of that? Or is it just a debugging tool, a stepping stone towards intelligent machines? <em><a href="/blog/2013/halfway-house">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="review-scott-christianson-100-diagrams-that-changed-the-world" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/review-scott-christianson-100-diagrams-changed-world">Review: Scott Christianson, 100 Diagrams That Changed the World</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#review-scott-christianson-100-diagrams-that-changed-the-world" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/review-scott-christianson-100-diagrams-changed-world&quot;&gt;Review: Scott Christianson, 100 Diagrams That Changed the World&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I recently came across this book that claims to collect the 100 most important diagrams in the history of mankind.

While the former two topics are covered well in the literature, there has been very little work specifically on presentation. In an upcoming paper, Jock Mackinlay and I argue that presentation, and in particular storytelling and communication of data, are the logical next step for the field, and provide some research directions. <em><a href="/blog/2013/paper-storytelling-step-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-state-of-information-visualization-2013" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/state-information-visualization-2013">The State of Information Visualization, 2013</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-state-of-information-visualization-2013" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/state-information-visualization-2013&quot;&gt;The State of Information Visualization, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Well, the world hasn’t ended, so here’s a look back at what happened in visualization in 2012, and a look ahead in case the world is still around a year from now. <em><a href="/blog/2013/state-information-visualization-2013">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
