Jon Schwabish invited me to be on his <a href="https://policyviz.com/podcast/episode-93-robert-kosara/">PolicyViz podcast</a> again to kick off its new season. And I have a long list of things to write about around that topic, too.</p><p>But first, the podcast: Jon and I <a href="https://policyviz.com/podcast/episode-93-robert-kosara/">talked about what it means for something to be a story</a>, and how you tell a story about data. Much of it revolved around the ideas in my <a href="/papers/paper-an-argument-structure-for-data-stories">EuroVis short paper on argument structure</a>. It was a fun and interesting conversation, and Jon kept it moving nicely.</p><p>Xaquín González Veira, former Visual Editor at The Guardian, has written <a href="https://medium.com/xocas/i-like-data-driven-storytelling-i-like-loaded-words-d066d83ee909">an interesting piece</a> in response. One of his points mirrors what I said (or meant to say):</p><blockquote><p>Too many pieces of data journalism fail to explain existing connections between the different bits of data it guides readers through.</p></blockquote><p>I have a few more things to say on this in particular, and on storytelling in general. I&#39;m not making this a very tight series on storytelling, but most of the next two months will be devoted to the topic in one way or another.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on September 13, 2017</em></p></div>`);
