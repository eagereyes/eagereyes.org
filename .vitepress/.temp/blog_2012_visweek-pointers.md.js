The idea is to extend the rather limited traditional visualization pipeline by also considering the user side, as well as turning it into a closed loop. I will present this paper in the second morning session on Sunday.</p><p>Also on Sunday, and unfortunately at the same time, Adam Price will present a paper he wrote with Cynthia Gibas and me at <a href="http://biovis.net/biovis/2012/papers-by-session">BioVis</a>, <a href="/publications/Price_BioVis_2012.html"><em>Gene-RiViT: A visualization tool for comparative analysis of gene neighborhoods in prokaryotes</em></a>. It’s a neat tool that does what many horribly clunky, text-based things are currently trying to do, but in a sleek and fast visual interface. It’s written in D3, runs in the browser, and talks to a server backend created with node.js and an OLAP-style database.</p><p>To round out the tour of workshops, Aritra and I have a paper in <a href="http://ldav.org">LDAV</a> on <a href="/publications/Dasgupta_LDAV_2012.html"><em>Meta Parallel Coordinates for Visualizing Features in Large, High-Dimensional, Time-varying Data</em></a>. We were hoping to have all three presentations in parallel, but this one was unfortunately pushed to Monday, the session after the keynote. The paper turns parallel coordinates on themselves by using them not to visualize the data, but metrics about what parallel coordinates would look like if they showed the data.
