We can redistribute their files, but we cannot alter them when we do that. You only have to run the program once, and you can delete it once all the contest data has been generated. <h3>What is the Netflix data?</h3> Netflix has a <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">contest</a> where it is looking for a way to significantly improve its recommendation service. Their data consists of ratings for 17,770 movies from about 100,000 costumers. This also includes a lot of direct-to-video releases, special editions, and movies that were made before 2000, which brings the number of Netflix ratings in this dataset down to around 1,400. Those ratings are interesting though because we do not only know the average, but also the standard deviation. <p>You have to register on the site to be able to download the data. We cannot redistribute the data, even in its original form. If you use the Netflix data, we recommend you look at the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/community/index.php">Netflix Prize Forums</a>.</p><h3>Where does all this data come from?</h3><ul><li>Most of it is from <a href="http://imdb.com/">The Internet Movie Database (IMDB)</a>.</li><li>Box office numbers come from <a href="http://the-numbers.com/">The-Numbers.com</a>.</li><li>Oscar information can be found all over the web, with the source of it all of course being <a href="http://oscar.com/">Oscar.com</a>.</li></ul> Thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/cziemki/">Caroline Ziemkiewicz</a> for help with the data collection. <h3>What is the license on this dataset?</h3> All the data sources we use are openly accessible and are likely to remain so. Their data is therefore licensed under their respective terms. The program code available from this page to digest and represent the data is hereby put in the public domain. This page and the dataset will remain online after the end of the contest. <h3>Where do I submit my results?</h3> That and more information can be found on the <a href="http://www.apl.jhu.edu/Misc/Visualization/">InfoVis 2007 Contest Website</a>. <p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on March 07, 2007</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Hadley Wickham says…</p><blockquote><p>Just to confirm - missing data is encoded as 0?</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>Good question! I added a short description of missing values in the Data section above.</p></blockquote><p>Hadley Wickham says…</p><blockquote><p>It also looks like any non-ASCII character is converted to an ?. Obviously, this doesn&#39;t make much difference to the analysis, but would make titles like &quot;?vangile du cochon cr?ole, L&#39;&quot; a little more interpretable.</p></blockquote><p>Hadley Wickham says…</p><blockquote><p>Great! (Although in general it&#39;s a bad idea to use numbers for missing values, it&#39;s probably a limitation of the software that you&#39;re using). Thanks. It&#39;s awesome to have someone so responsive looking after the data.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>... in this case the semantics are clear. When there are no ratings, the number of ratings is 0. In that case, there is no point in even looking at the mean or standard deviation. But I changed it so that the ratings mean and std dev are NaN (not a number) in the code when there are no ratings, and the ratings are no longer written to the file if there are none (that includes the number of ratings). Box office earnings are now -1 (used to be 0) when nonexistant, and are no longer written to file in that case.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>Turns out Xerces doesn&#39;t do the UTF-8 encoding itself, but needs the OutputStream to handle that. So now the output is correct UTF-8, like the XML header promises, and no more mangled characters.</p><p>Thanks for all the bug reports! </p></blockquote><p>Hadley Wickham says…</p><blockquote><p>You&#39;re welcome - it&#39;s great to have some one responsive who can fix them as they up. The missing data looks much better too.</p><p>One more thing - could you please comment on how you added the box office numbers? Some very popular movies (lord of the rings series, memento, kill bill, new star wars, mission impossible 2) don&#39;t have any box office data, even though it is available on the-numbers.com.</p><p>Thanks again!</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>The matching between IMDB and other sources is not easy. There are differences in how the names are arranged, and IMDB also numbers movies with the same title that come out in the same year - that happens more often than you&#39;d expect. I will look into this and try to improve the matching. The Netflix matching code tries a little harder, but there is clearly still room for improvement as well.</p></blockquote><p>Hadley Wickham says…</p><blockquote><p>I think you&#39;ve miscoded the missing release dates as the 1st of February, not the 1st of January. (And if that is true, then there are 87 movies which were actually released on the 1st of Jan)</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>Okay, no more encoding of missing values in numbers. You&#39;re right about the February, Java&#39;s handling of dates is not very logical. Jan 1 was chosen because it is a fairly uncommon release data, and a special day.</p><p>But no more! There is a separate field for the year now (required), and the release date is only there when we know it. It&#39;s also null in the objects if it&#39;s not there.</p><p>The new release &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; is now available for download from the links above.</p></blockquote><p>James Shearer says…</p><blockquote><p>Excellent dataset, Robert. Contest should be lots o&#39; fun this year. I can&#39;t wait to get some free time to hack on this 😃</p></blockquote><p>Hadley Wickham says…</p><blockquote><p>Thanks! We&#39;ll make a statistician out of you yet 😉 And, yes, matching is always a bitch, but that&#39;s real life.</p></blockquote><p>Mark Derthick says…</p><blockquote><p>The IMdB requires explicit permission to use their data, except for individual personal use. I assume, therefore, that I can&#39;t make my contest entry available over the web for others to try. Is this correct?</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>Mark, good question! I assume that you can put it online as long as you don&#39;t allow people to query the entire data (this is very reduced, anyway), and don&#39;t show all the details. I will clarify that with the IMDB folks, though.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://emislej.googlepages.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ernesto Mislej</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Hi! I found this error in IMDBBootStrapper.java The filename is hardcoded. <code> ...

You can either download that or replace the offending line with the following in the code, and recompile:</p><blockquote><pre>NetflixParser.parse(dialog.getNetflixPath()+File.separator+&quot;training_set.tar&quot;, dialog); </pre></blockquote></blockquote><p><a href="http://emislej.googlepages.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ernesto Mislej</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Hi!</p><p>Can I add extra data, like plot outline keywords, to the dataset?
