Especially when it comes to fancy infographic bar charts, it can easily distort the value&#39;s appearance. Why that is, and where else this can happen, isn&#39;t always obvious. In my new video, I show how it happens and how to do it right – and how this issue inspired ISOTYPE.</p><p>This is essentially the video version of <a href="/blog/2008/linear-vs-quadratic-change" data-type="post" data-id="235">a blog post I wrote on linear vs. quadratic change</a> some 12 yers ago. Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic reminded me of it in a Clubhouse conversation (remember Clubhouse?) a month or so ago. So I decided to turn this into a little video.</p><p>There&#39;s also the infographic you see in the thumbnail, which made the rounds last year and I recently thought of it again. My concern is less with the icons and the color scheme, and more with the exaggeration of the differences. I explain how this happens, why it&#39;s a problem with pictorial bar charts in particular, and where else it can happen. And it isn&#39;t always in the most obvious places, not everybody immediately understands that the area of a circle wedge grows with the square of the radius, for example. Anyway, more on all that in the video.</p><p>This video takes a different approach than my previous ones in that it&#39;s all motion graphics, no more me talking into the camera. That&#39;s obviously a ton of work, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the way to go for all my videos, but it has been an interesting experiment and I&#39;ve learned a lot in making this – and I&#39;m very curious to see what people think and how well this video does.</p><p>Below is the teaser, <a href="https://youtu.be/BW3YNLsmn8U">watch the full video (in all its 6:08 glory) over on YouTube!</a></p><p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9IibfqOEt4?si=LnmSVx-F4SDMkU2a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>As always, let me know what you think! This is a different approach than my other videos, does it work?</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on June 15, 2021.

It&#39;s pretty clear that this is wrong. But what&#39;s right?</p><p>After some exchange with others, I find this question much harder to answer, actually. Li et al.&#39;s work from 2010 [1], for ex., suggests that the truth is somewhere in the middle.</p><p>If you&#39;d consider the following three sequences: <a href="https://folk.uib.no/hha109/LinVsArea/Ruf.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://folk.uib.no/hha109/LinVsArea/Ruf.PNG</a> <a href="https://folk.uib.no/hha109/LinVsArea/Sir.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://folk.uib.no/hha109/LinVsArea/Sir.PNG</a> <a href="https://folk.uib.no/hha109/LinVsArea/Tau.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://folk.uib.no/hha109/LinVsArea/Tau.PNG</a> -- which one, would you say, corresponds, perceptually, to a linear data sequence?</p><p>Do you know of other studies that attempted to actually derive the right mapping?</p><p>I&#39;d expect that it easily may depend on the aspect ratio of the scaled area, as well.</p><p>[1] J.
