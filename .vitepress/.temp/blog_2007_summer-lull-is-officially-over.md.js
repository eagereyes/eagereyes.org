Perhaps you could explore some of papers from the lists of influences in more detail? It would also be interesting to see your list of influences, and to learn more about your interests in critiquing visualisations, perhaps with some actual critiques. Stephen Few has nice critiques of commercial graphics, and it would be nice to see critiques of research graphics as well.</p><p>Hadley</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>Good ideas, thanks! I will definitely write more critiques, and I am also planning on discussing more papers, especially as the InfoVis conference draws nearer.
