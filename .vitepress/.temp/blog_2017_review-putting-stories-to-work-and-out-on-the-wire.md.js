In particular, he advocates the use of anecdotes and he insists that the stories you tell must be true and must be yours (and if not, you have to tell people so you don’t risk making a fool of yourself).</p><p>Callahan endeared himself to me early on in the book with his criticism of the overuse of the term <em>story</em>:</p><blockquote><p>Everyone is talking about stories these days: ‘What’s the story of our business?’ ‘What’s the story of our product?’ ‘What’s my personal story?’ I even saw an advertisement in a shirt shop on Fifth Avenue in New York announcing the story of the shirts. But if you listen carefully, you’ll discover that many people who purport to share a story are not actually sharing one at all. It’s as if they think that if they are talking, they are telling a story.</p></blockquote><p>The point of the book is to use stories to make a specific point: establish your credibility, get ahead of potential counterarguments, get people to listen rather than think of what to say next, etc. To do that, you have to mine for stories. That is easier than it seems, but it requires some process and practice. But it’s also useful, because it opens your eyes to the stories (and non-stories) around you.</p><p>This is a business book, but like <em>Made to Stick</em> it’s equal parts fascinating and fun to read. Callahan’s company isn’t called <em>Anecdote</em> for nothing, the book is filled with tons of stories that illustrate his points, thus also illustrating his overall point that stories are useful.</p><h2 id="telling-stories-in-journalism" tabindex="-1">Telling Stories in Journalism <a class="header-anchor" href="#telling-stories-in-journalism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Telling Stories in Journalism&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://jessicaabel.com/out-on-the-wire/">Jessica Abel’s <em>Out on the Wire</em></a> is a comic about how radio is made. If the idea of reading a serious comic puts you off, you haven’t read any good comics (serious or not). Abel’s book fits right in with great comics like Scott McCloud’s <em><a href="http://scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/">Understanding Comics</a></em>, Nick Sousanis’ <a href="http://spinweaveandcut.com/unflattening/"><em>Unflattening</em></a>, or Doxiadis et al.’s <em><a href="https://www.logicomix.com/">Logicomix</a></em>.</p><p>She tells many stories about radio, in particular the NPR programs <em>This American Life</em> and <em>Snap Judgment</em>. There are many interesting insights into how they find and shape stories, how stories change as they develop, and how the agonizing creative process is playing out even in these well-known radio programs that have been going on for many years.</p><p>The book is very nicely structured and Abel works in many little details while focusing on a number of important messages. Perhaps the most interesting to me were the two key ways of expressing a story’s point. There is the <em>story formula,</em> which is a good test for many data stories:</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on September 18, 2017</em></p></div>`);
