The idea is stolen from Mr. <a href="http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a>, though in contrast I&#39;m planning on actually following through. ðŸ˜‰ I will write about the sessions I attend, papers I find notable, and any insights I think are worth sharing.</p><p>The plan is to write about 5-10 postings a day, depending on things I find interesting and how much time I have. I call these &quot;glimpses,&quot; as a little play on &quot;tweets.&quot; The reason I&#39;m not using Twitter for this is that Twitter is just too limiting for any kind of meaningful comment, and I want to be able to post links without that abomination of tinyURL. I&#39;m also still debating whether to activate comments on those glimpses, because they&#39;re not really meant to be full postings (i.e., there won&#39;t be a teaser and body, only the body) â€“ but that&#39;s another thing I can&#39;t do with Twitter.</p><p>Having said that, <a href="http://twitter.com/EagerEyes">I do use Twitter</a>, and I will tweet things when I don&#39;t have my laptop with me, or the information does not seem relevant enough for this site.</p><p>I will also take pictures, as I have in the past (like at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eagereyes/sets/72157603653791487/">Vis 2004</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eagereyes/sets/72157603651989017/">2005</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/eagereyes/collections/72157603647232879/">a few other venues</a>). I will try to post these quickly to Flickr, and then link there from here. Expect pictures especially from the social events, and perhaps a few taken during the day (I generally do not carry my camera with me all the time, especially because I&#39;m not staying at the conference hotel).</p><p>To those of you going to Columbus, I hope to meet many of you!
