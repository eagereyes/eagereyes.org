The program will not be able to do everything from the beginning, but those things it can do will need to work. I want to avoid the situation where people download the program only to be annoyed so much by its bugs that they never check back for updates.</p><p>Since the program is written in Java, it will run on a variety of platforms. Just providing the jar files is not exactly a great user experience, though. Instead, the Parallel Sets will behave like native programs on Windows and the Mac. That of course requires some additional work and testing.</p><p>But, to be honest, most of the last few weeks was actually spent on one particular thing: picking the right font for the logo. I think it has paid off.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on April 29, 2009</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://diuf.unifr.ch/people/bertinie/visuale/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Enrico Bertini</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Hi Robert,</p><p>Bravo!
