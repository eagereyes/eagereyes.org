I&#39;m showing a few examples, including housing prices and the Case-Schiller Home Prince Index, but also climate data and retail sales during the current economic downturn. I&#39;ll do a second part about indexing on the time axis (which is more fun) in a couple of weeks.</p><p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qs7h19vaqQc?si=ViuZbiOcXxaPZ0a9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>As usual, let me know what you think!
