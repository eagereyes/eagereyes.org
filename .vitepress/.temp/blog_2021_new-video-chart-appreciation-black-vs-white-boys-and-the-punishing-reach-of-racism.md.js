It uses several different charts, some of them animated, others static. I talk about a few of them in the video, but you should check out the original article as well because there&#39;s a lot to take in there.</p><p>I&#39;m embedding the teaser video here, but you&#39;ll have to <a href="https://youtu.be/VDXCYV7sbmw">head over to YouTube to watch the full video</a>.</p><p align="center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YszGGETTY6A?si=w_WUhuSziJ91gNgL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>As always, I would appreciate feedback.
