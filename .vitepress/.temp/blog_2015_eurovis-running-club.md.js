If you&#39;re attending the conference, don&#39;t forget to bring your running shoes and leave your excuses at home.</p><p>This is even less organized than than the <a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-monday">VIS running club.</a> I&#39;m not going to have you fill out a form. Instead, just drop me an email (rkosara at my <a href="http://tableau.com/">employer&#39;s domain</a> or use the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>) if you&#39;re interested in joining. This is just so I can send out information about the secret meeting place and time (most likely Monday morning at 7am in the conference hotel lobby).</p><p>We&#39;ll aim for about 30-40 mins, for a distance of about 5-8km (3-5mi). Pace will depend on who&#39;s there and how fast they want to go. Don&#39;t be shy about wanting to go slow, we won&#39;t be turning this into a race. The first run will be Monday, and then we&#39;ll figure out what to do from there (probably Wednesday and Friday, plus potentially something longer Friday afternoon or Saturday).</p><p>I know you&#39;re wondering: <em>what if I&#39;m not running, will there be opportunities to experience my amazing wisdom and speaking skills?</em> I&#39;m glad you asked.</p><ul><li>I will be part of the closing panel at <a href="http://www.eurorvvv.org/program/">EuroRVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV</a> Tuesday morning.</li><li>I&#39;m giving the talk for the paper <i>VIMTEX: A Visualization Interface for Multivariate, Time-Varying Geological Data Exploration</i> by Aritra Dasgupta, Robert Kosara, and Luke Gosink on Thursday morning (session FP10)</li><li>I&#39;m giving the Tableau industrial/sponsor talk on Thursday afternoon (session IND2). No, that will not be a sales pitch but there will be actual content and bad jokes. Lots of them.</li><li>Finally, Drew Skau will give the talk on Wednesday morning (session FP6) on our paper with Lane Harrison, <i>An Evaluation of the Impact of Visual Embellishments in Bar Charts</i>. There will be a separate posting about this paper on Sunday.</li></ul><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on May 20, 2015</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>WANG Qichao ; WANG Lisha says…</p><blockquote><p>We would love to join in your running club! see you on monday!</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
