But there are many others that are not as well known, but often contain really interesting work. They offer thoughtful criticism, discussions of the cognitive aspects of visualization, or designers&#39; perspectives on visualization.

On <a href="http://www.zcliu.org/blog" target="_blank">his blog</a>, he covers topics like cognition, model-building in visualization, storytelling, etc. He does not write very much (the last posting as of this writing is from six months ago), but what he writes is very interesting. I also like the fact that he experiments with different posting formats, like in his <em><a href="http://www.zcliu.org/archives/replies-to-a-fictitious-skeptic">Replies to a fictitious skeptic</a></em>.</p><h2 id="enrico-bertini-fell-in-love-with-data" tabindex="-1">Enrico Bertini, Fell In Love With Data <a class="header-anchor" href="#enrico-bertini-fell-in-love-with-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Enrico Bertini, Fell In Love With Data&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Enrico has been blogging for a while, though in a somewhat unpredictable manner. His new(ish) blog, <a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/" target="_blank">Fell In Love With Data</a> combines more academic discussions with topics that have broader appeal, like his <em><a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/guides/7-classic-foundational-vis-papers" target="_blank">7 Classic Foundational Vis Papers You Might not Want to Publicly Confess you Donâ€™t Know</a></em>. His writing can be a bit chaotic, but he covers a lot of relevant topics, and provides a lot of links to further resources.</p><h2 id="connie-malamed-understanding-graphics" tabindex="-1">Connie Malamed, Understanding Graphics <a class="header-anchor" href="#connie-malamed-understanding-graphics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Connie Malamed, Understanding Graphics&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Connie Malamed may not be a household name in visualization, but her book <a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/visual-language-for-designers/" target="_blank">Visual Language for Designers</a> is widely known and respected among designers. On <a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/" target="_blank">her website/blog</a>, she writes occasional postings that tend to be very thoughtful and interesting. In particular, her <a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/brainy/understanding-schematic-faces/" target="_blank">recent article on schematic faces and smileys</a> is an interesting take on something we almost take for granted today.</p><h2 id="bryan-connor-the-why-axis" tabindex="-1">Bryan Connor, The Why Axis <a class="header-anchor" href="#bryan-connor-the-why-axis" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bryan Connor, The Why Axis&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>While a lot of designers&#39; work is criticized in the usual visualization blogs, I have not seen much writing on visualization by designers. Bryan Connor&#39;s cleverly titled <a href="http://thewhyaxis.info/" target="_blank">The Why Axis</a> is a welcome exception. Connor writes thoughtful critiques of visualizations and infographics, and interestingly focuses a lot on interaction. &quot;Interestingly,&quot; because most criticism I see is based on the static aspects of charts. His writing is top-notch, though he seems a bit overly careful not too step on people&#39;s toes at times.</p><h2 id="carla-casilli" tabindex="-1">Carla Casilli <a class="header-anchor" href="#carla-casilli" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Carla Casilli&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p><a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/" target="_blank">Carla Casilli</a> writes about media psychology, cognition, social media, and recently visualization. She recently wrote a very interesting eight-part series about information visualization as a new visual language: <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/a-new-visual-language-part-1" target="_blank">part 1</a>, <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/a-new-visual-language-part-2" target="_blank">part 2</a>, <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/a-new-visual-language-part-3" target="_blank">part 3</a>, <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/a-new-visual-language-part-4" target="_blank">part 4</a>, <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/information-visualization-a-new-visual-langua" target="_blank">part 5</a>, <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/information-visualization-a-new-visual-langua-0" target="_blank">part 6</a>, <a href="http://carlacasilli.posterous.com/information-visualization-a-new-visual-langua-2" target="_blank">part 7</a>, part 8 (not yet published). Casilli discusses cognitive aspects as well as semiotics, visual working memory, and a host of other issues. If you want to get an idea of the breadth of fields visualization touches, this is a great starting point.</p><h2 id="xkcd" tabindex="-1">xkcd <a class="header-anchor" href="#xkcd" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;xkcd&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Many of you may know <a href="http://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">xkcd&#39;s brilliant comics</a>. But Randall Munroe, the guy behind those stick figures, also creates some of the most impressive visualizations. A few years ago, his <a href="http://xkcd.com/195/" target="_blank">Map of the Internet</a> made waves for showing the entire IPv4 address space on a single chart. More recently, he created <a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/03/19/radiation-chart/" target="_blank">the most interesting and useful illustrations of radiation doses</a> I have seen. He also did an <a href="http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/05/08/michael-bays-scenario/" target="_blank">interesting posting on the Mississippi floods</a> a few days ago.</p><p><a href="http://blag.xkcd.com/" target="_blank">Munroe&#39;s &quot;blag&quot;</a> is obviously not a visualization blog, and he doesn&#39;t post very often, much less interesting visualizations. But when he does, they are very, very good.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on May 12, 2011</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Zhicheng Liu saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>Thanks a lot for the nice words Robert, they are definitely a strong motivation for me to blog more!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://fellinlovewithdata.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Enrico Bertini</a> saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>Some here.
