But why? Why filter and not just let anybody publish whatever they want? <em><a href="/blog/2014/peer-review-part-5-the-importance-of-gatekeepers">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="peer-review-part-4-good-reasons-for-bad-papers" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/4-good-reasons-for-bad-papers">Peer Review, Part 4: Good Reasons for Bad Papers</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#peer-review-part-4-good-reasons-for-bad-papers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/4-good-reasons-for-bad-papers&quot;&gt;Peer Review, Part 4: Good Reasons for Bad Papers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As a reviewer, you might sometimes ask yourself why people write so many bad papers. And why they bother submitting them. I certainly do. But where do they come from? Who submits bad papers? And why? It may come as a surprise, but there are good reasons to submit bad papers for review. <em><a href="/blog/2014/4-good-reasons-for-bad-papers">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="peer-review-part-3-a-taxonomy-of-bad-papers" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/3-a-taxonomy-of-bad-papers">Peer Review, Part 3: A Taxonomy of Bad Papers</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#peer-review-part-3-a-taxonomy-of-bad-papers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/3-a-taxonomy-of-bad-papers&quot;&gt;Peer Review, Part 3: A Taxonomy of Bad Papers&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Reviewing is great when you get a good paper where you can make some suggestions to make it even better, and everybody’s happy. Bad papers are much less fun, but they are also much more common. Here are some examples I’ve seen and that I keep seeing. <em><a href="/blog/2014/3-a-taxonomy-of-bad-papers">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="peer-review-part-2-how-it-works" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/2-how-it-works">Peer Review, Part 2: How It Works</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#peer-review-part-2-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/2-how-it-works&quot;&gt;Peer Review, Part 2: How It Works&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Peer review is one of the central pillars of academic publishing. But how does it actually work? What is blind review, and what is it good for? This part will answer those questions, and then tell you how to be a good reviewer yourself. <em><a href="/blog/2014/2-how-it-works">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="peer-review-part-1-quilt-plots" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/1-quilt-plots">Peer Review, Part 1: Quilt Plots</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#peer-review-part-1-quilt-plots" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/1-quilt-plots&quot;&gt;Peer Review, Part 1: Quilt Plots&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>What is peer review? How does it work? And is it really as flawed as people claim it is? In this little series, I will talk about all that, and then end up arguing that peer review does, in fact, work - at least in visualization. But first an example where it didn’t. <em><a href="/blog/2014/1-quilt-plots">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
