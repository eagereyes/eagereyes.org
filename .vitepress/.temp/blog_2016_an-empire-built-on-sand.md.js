In a paper to be presented at <a href="http://beliv.cs.univie.ac.at">the BELIV workshop</a> at VIS next week, I&#39;m making the case for that more extensively than I have so far. The full title of the paper is <a href="/publications/Kosara-BELIV-2016"><em>An Empire Built On Sand: Reexamining What We Think We Know About Visualization</em></a>.</p><p>The paper starts out by talking about <a href="/papers/a-pair-of-pie-chart-papers">the recent pie charts work</a> where Drew Skau and I showed that the 90-year old belief that we read pie charts by angle does not appear to be correct. I&#39;ve collected a few more examples, most of which show how a belief turned out to not be true after some further study. Sometimes our beliefs turn out to be correct, of course, and I have one or two examples to show that as well.</p><p>My point is not that everything we know is wrong, but that we need to ask a simple question: <em>How do we know that?</em> And if we can&#39;t point to actual research, we need to do that research. And even when there is existing research, we need to keep questioning that.</p><p>After all, this is how an actual science works: facts are collected and theories put forward, and those are believed until they&#39;re shown to be false or incomplete. But just relying on a handful of books that are based on little or no research doesn&#39;t make for a good foundation if we ever want to claim visualization to be a science.</p><p>We also need to be more critical of the seminal papers we like to keep citing over and over. They are obviously important, but they&#39;re not sacrosanct. The same is true for <a href="/blog/2016/the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization#the-repetitive-and-boring-history-of-visualization">the handful of classic visualization pieces</a> we love a little bit too much.</p><p>I also have some specific suggestions in the paper, both about systematic research and a list of research topics that lend themselves to systematic studies. There&#39;s also criticism of the current funding situation that makes it difficult to get funding for this kind of foundational research – even and in particular from certain foundations that ostensibly fund science on a national level.</p><p>Anyway, I&#39;m happy that BELIV accepted this rather opinionated paper (it&#39;s a position paper, not research) and I&#39;m looking forward to the discussion next Monday!</p><hr><p>Robert Kosara, <em><a href="/publications/Kosara-BELIV-2016">An Empire Built On Sand: Reexamining What We Think We Know About Visualization</a>,</em> Beyond Time And Errors: Novel Evaluation Methods For Visualization (BELIV), 2016</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 16, 2016</em></p></div>`);
