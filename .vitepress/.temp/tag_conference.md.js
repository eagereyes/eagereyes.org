And CHI’s scope is very broad, it covers many areas that are not strictly part of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction – why use one acronym when you can have two?). <em><a href="/blog/2015/conference-report-chi-2015">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="vis-2014-observations-and-thoughts" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-observations-and-thoughts">VIS 2014 Observations and Thoughts</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vis-2014-observations-and-thoughts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/vis-2014-observations-and-thoughts&quot;&gt;VIS 2014 Observations and Thoughts&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While I’ve covered individual talks and events at IEEE VIS 2014, there are also some overall observations – positive and negative – I thought would be interesting to write down to see what others were thinking. <em><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-observations-and-thoughts">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="vis-2014-–-friday" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-friday">VIS 2014 – Friday</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vis-2014-–-friday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/vis-2014-friday&quot;&gt;VIS 2014 – Friday&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Wow, that was fast! VIS 2014 is already over. This year’s last day was shorter than in previous years, with just one morning session and then the closing session with the capstone talk. <em><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-friday">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="vis-2014-–-thursday" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-thursday">VIS 2014 – Thursday</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vis-2014-–-thursday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/vis-2014-thursday&quot;&gt;VIS 2014 – Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Thursday was the penultimate day of VIS 2014. I ended up only going to InfoVis sessions, and unfortunately missed a panel I had been planning to see. The papers were a bit more mixed, but there were agains some really good ones. <em><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-thursday">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="vis-2014-–-wednesday" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-wednesday">VIS 2014 – Wednesday</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vis-2014-–-wednesday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/vis-2014-wednesday&quot;&gt;VIS 2014 – Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Wednesday is more than the halfway point of the conference, and was clearly the high point so far. There were some great papers, the arts program, and I got to see the Bertin exhibit. <em><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-wednesday">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="vis-2014-–-tuesday" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-tuesday">VIS 2014 – Tuesday</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vis-2014-–-tuesday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/vis-2014-tuesday&quot;&gt;VIS 2014 – Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The big opening day of the conference, Tuesday, brought us a keynote, talks, and panels. Also, a new trend I really like: many talks end with the URL of a webpage that contains a brief summary of the paper, the PDF, and often even a link to the source code of the tool they developed. <em><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-tuesday">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="vis-2014-–-monday" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-monday">VIS 2014 – Monday</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#vis-2014-–-monday" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/vis-2014-monday&quot;&gt;VIS 2014 – Monday&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>IEEE VIS 2014 technically began on Saturday, with the first full day open to all attendees being Sunday. Monday continued the workshops and tutorials, and that is where we join our intrepid reporter. <em><a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-monday">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="tapestry-2014-announced" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/tapestry-2014-announced">Tapestry 2014 Announced</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tapestry-2014-announced" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/tapestry-2014-announced&quot;&gt;Tapestry 2014 Announced&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>After a very successful Tapestry conference in February this year, we have been getting a steady stream of questions from people about another event next year. Now we&#39;re finally able to announce next year&#39;s event. And it will be awesome, again. <em><a href="/blog/2013/tapestry-2014-announced">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="report-from-ieee-vis-2013-in-atlanta-ga" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2013/report-from-ieee-vis-2013-in-atlanta-ga">Report from IEEE VIS 2013 in Atlanta, GA</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#report-from-ieee-vis-2013-in-atlanta-ga" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/report-from-ieee-vis-2013-in-atlanta-ga&quot;&gt;Report from IEEE VIS 2013 in Atlanta, GA&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There were parties, papers, and presentations. The keynote involved ramen, the capstone cited Rams. Lies were told, we watched stories unfold, and stacked bars of gold. The first IEEE VIS took place inside a giant alien, and the dinosaurs were particularly memorable. <em><a href="/blog/2013/report-from-ieee-vis-2013-in-atlanta-ga">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="tapestry-the-conference-about-storytelling-with-data" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/tapestry-conference-storytelling-data">Tapestry, The Conference About Storytelling With Data</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tapestry-the-conference-about-storytelling-with-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/tapestry-conference-storytelling-data&quot;&gt;Tapestry, The Conference About Storytelling With Data&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Tapestry is a new conference on storytelling with data. While it focuses on visual ways of telling stories in journalism, there will be a broad range of topics, and a line-up of amazing speakers. <em><a href="/blog/2012/tapestry-conference-storytelling-data">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visweek-2012-digest-part-3" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-2012-digest-part-3">VisWeek 2012 Digest, Part 3</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visweek-2012-digest-part-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visweek-2012-digest-part-3&quot;&gt;VisWeek 2012 Digest, Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This final installment of the digest sums up a few more thoughts on this year&#39;s VisWeek.

There was some remarkable work, which I think and hope will shape the future of visualization research. <em><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-2012-digest-part-2">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visweek-2012-digest-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-2012-digest-part-1">VisWeek 2012 Digest, Part 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visweek-2012-digest-part-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visweek-2012-digest-part-1&quot;&gt;VisWeek 2012 Digest, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I gorged myself on talks, panels, and tutorials last week. And parties, oh the parties. Time to digest all of it and, um, extract the most important bits. Since there is so much to talk about, I have split this up into three parts. Parts 1 and 2 will discuss individual papers and events, part 3 will add some more general observations. <em><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-2012-digest-part-1">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visweek-2012-day-one" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-2012-day-one">VisWeek 2012, Day One</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visweek-2012-day-one" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visweek-2012-day-one&quot;&gt;VisWeek 2012, Day One&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>VisWeek 2012 started today, and it started with quite a bang. Here are some observations and highlights from the first day. <em><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-2012-day-one">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-visweek-survival-guide-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-2">A VisWeek Survival Guide, Part 2</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-visweek-survival-guide-part-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-2&quot;&gt;A VisWeek Survival Guide, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Less than two weeks to go until VisWeek 2012, so it’s time for the crucial second part of the survival guide. There are tons of things to see and do in Seattle, it’s easy to get distracted. <em><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-2">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-visweek-survival-guide-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-1">A VisWeek Survival Guide, Part 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-visweek-survival-guide-part-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-1&quot;&gt;A VisWeek Survival Guide, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>VisWeek 2012 will be held October 14 to 19 in Seattle, WA. The conference keeps growing, and this year is adding a new industry track. If you consider going, you should register by Friday to get the early registration discount. <em><a href="/blog/2012/visweek-survival-guide-part-1">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="eurovis-2012-last-day-and-wrap-up" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-wrap-up">EuroVis 2012, Last Day and Wrap-Up</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#eurovis-2012-last-day-and-wrap-up" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-wrap-up&quot;&gt;EuroVis 2012, Last Day and Wrap-Up&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The last day of EuroVis brought back the sunshine we had seen yesterday, but had missed for the first half of the conference. This was a short day, with only one paper session and the keynote. The latter proved to be quite controversial and interesting. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-wrap-up">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="eurovis-2012-day-3" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-3">EuroVis 2012, Day 3</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#eurovis-2012-day-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-3&quot;&gt;EuroVis 2012, Day 3&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I missed a few of the papers I wanted to see today, but there were again some interesting ones. The big event of the day was of course the social event at a Heuriger. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-3">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="eurovis-2012-day-2" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-2">EuroVis 2012, Day 2</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#eurovis-2012-day-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-2&quot;&gt;EuroVis 2012, Day 2&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Day 2 of EuroVis was a long series of paper presentations, occasionally interrupted with copious amounts of food. Here are some of the highlights. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-2">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="eurovis-2012-day-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-1">EuroVis 2012, Day 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#eurovis-2012-day-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-1&quot;&gt;EuroVis 2012, Day 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>EuroVis 2012 has officially begun, so here is a brief recap of some of the things I found interesting. Today, that included the EuroRVVV workshop and two papers. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-2012-day-1">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-2">A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 2</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-2&quot;&gt;A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Only a few more sleeps until EuroVis! As we approach the big date, here are some practical tips and tricks about Vienna, the local culture and the exotic customs of the natives. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-2">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-1">A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-eurovis-survival-guide-part-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-1&quot;&gt;A EuroVis Survival Guide, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>EuroVis 2012 is only about six weeks away, so if you haven&#39;t booked your travel or hotel, now is the time. Here are a few pointers on where to stay, transportation options in Vienna, etc. <em><a href="/blog/2012/eurovis-survival-guide-part-1">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visweek-2008-live-microblog-archive" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2008/visweek2008">VisWeek 2008 Live-Microblog Archive</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visweek-2008-live-microblog-archive" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/visweek2008&quot;&gt;VisWeek 2008 Live-Microblog Archive&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>During VisWeek 2008, I wrote short updates on my website, which I called glimpses (a little pun on tweet). This is an archive of all of those, in reverse chronological order. In my transition to WordPress, I had to get rid of the comments, unfortunately. There were only a small number of those attached to these postings, though. <em><a href="/blog/2008/visweek2008">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses">InfoVis 2007: InfoVis for the Masses</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses&quot;&gt;InfoVis 2007: InfoVis for the Masses&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The InfoVis conference this year had a theme that was not planned, but that made it even more impressive. That theme was InfoVis for the Masses, or Visualization for the People, and it was present throughout the keynote, many paper presentations, the panel, the World Visualization Day BOF, and the capstone. This is the beginning of a new era in visualization, and it is exciting to watch it happen. <em><a href="/blog/2007/infovis-2007-infovis-for-the-masses">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="infovis-panel-the-impact-of-social-data-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/panel-social-data-visualization">InfoVis Panel: The Impact of Social Data Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#infovis-panel-the-impact-of-social-data-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/panel-social-data-visualization&quot;&gt;InfoVis Panel: The Impact of Social Data Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Visualization for the masses is a powerful means of communication, in an age where we have access to incredible amounts of data, but still little understanding based of what it all means. I have argued that visualization sets information free, I have criticized Swivel and Many-Eyes, and I have argued for reassessing who our users are. At Vis/InfoVis, I am organizing a panel with people from Many-Eyes, Swivel, and Gapminder. <em><a href="/blog/2007/panel-social-data-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
