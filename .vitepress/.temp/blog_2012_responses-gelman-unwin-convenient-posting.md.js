It&#39;s baffling, quite frankly, that there are only a handful of people who know and understand both communities, when they share so many ideas, principles, and goals.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on December 05, 2012</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://had.co.nz" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hadley</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Thanks for doing this Robert!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://gravatar.com/dianakornbrot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dianakornbrot</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>How can there be any serious consideration of statistical graphics that ignores Rosling and gapminder?</p><p>Infovis is mostly &#39;fluff&#39; and does not seem to have any scatter plot options up front.</p><p><a href="http://www.gapminder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.gapminder.org/</a></p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
