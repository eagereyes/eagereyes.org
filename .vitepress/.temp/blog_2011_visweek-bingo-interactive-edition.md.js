For this year, I have created an interactive version of it for your perusal and amusement. It uses code <a href="http://stevestreza.com/">Steve Streza</a> developed for his <a href="http://applebingo.me/">Apple Keynote Bingo</a>.</p><h2 id="design" tabindex="-1">Design <a class="header-anchor" href="#design" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Design&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The idea behind this is that there are two modes: before the event, you can click on a square to change it randomly into something else. Your selection is stored in the URL and a cookie, so when you come back, it will be like you left it.</p><p>Once the event starts, the interaction changes: now you can highlight squares by clicking/tapping them, but they no longer change. This was clearly made for shorter events (i.e., Apple keynotes), not week-long conferences, so it doesn&#39;t remember the state of squares in a cookie. If you leave it open as a tab on your computer or your phone&#39;s browser, it should work, though.</p><p>This is optimized for mobile phones, in particular the iPhone 4(S). It works well on larger screens as well, though I hear it does not load in Internet Explorer (it does work in virtually every other desktop browser, though). I simply don&#39;t have the time to fix this, but if somebody can figure out what the issue is and perhaps suggest a fix, I&#39;ll be happy to apply it (and give credit).</p><h2 id="additions" tabindex="-1">Additions <a class="header-anchor" href="#additions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Additions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I already received a few good suggestions from Wolfgang Freiler, Jérôme Cukier, and Drew Skau when I <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/105888953757264157781/posts/D2iVnm8ofUh">posted about it on Google+</a>. Feel free to post more suggestions below, there are still some slots I can fill in the program. They have to be very short to fit into the squares, though.</p><h2 id="where-to-find-it" tabindex="-1">Where to Find It <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-find-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to Find It&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Just click on the image below:</p><p class="img"><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/media/2011/visweek-bingo.png" alt="" width="600" height="400"></p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 10, 2011</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://www.theusRus.de/blog" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Martin Theus</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>... great post, is there anything more to say? Given all the ingredients, we now could simulate visweek altogether.
