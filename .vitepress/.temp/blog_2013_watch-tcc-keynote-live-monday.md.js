The people there are almost all customers already, so they don’t need to be convinced. CEO Christian Chabot gives a great talk about how discoveries happen based on data, and some of the features we will be presenting will also be of more general interest.</p><p>The entire keynote will be about two hours long. It starts with a 45-minute presentation by Christian Chabot. Then, Chris Stolte (Chief Development Officer) will give a presentation on some great thinkers in computing how they changed the way we work with software. At the end, Chris will ask seven developers onto the stage.</p><p>That’s where I come in, as one of the developers: I will be showing a very cool new feature. Chris will talk about the bigger vision for each of the features we demo.</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2605" alt="TCC Developers on Stage" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tcc-devs-on-stage.jpg" width="600" height="354"></p><p><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/39494039">Here’s the link again</a>, as well as the times on Monday when the keynote starts in different time zones (don&#39;t expect it to start exactly on time, though, we might be a few minutes late).</p><ul><li>Europe (CEST): 7:15pm</li><li>Great Britain (BST): 6:15pm</li><li>U.S. East Coast (EDT): 1:15pm</li><li>U.S. West Coast (PDT): 10:15am</li></ul><p>What you won’t be getting in the live stream is the amazing 200ft (70m) wide screen and some of the production values.
