Elements of glitz should be chosen sparingly and to enhance the visual communication of the story behind the data. I agree, it&#39;s not a very deep lesson, but it&#39;s an important one!</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://theresamarierhyne.com/Theresa-Marie_Rhynes_Viewpoint/Welcome.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Theresa-Marie Rhyne</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Here is the URL to Wayne Lytle&#39;s biography at his company&#39;s (Animusic - Computer Animated Music) web site: <a href="http://www.animusic.com/company/wayne-lytle.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.animusic.com/company/wayne-lytle.php</a></p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
