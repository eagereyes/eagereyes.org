Badly thought-out slides, boring structure, poorly delivered. I once told a colleague after a practice talk to please shoot me before she’d ever make me sit through such a talk again (to be fair, she had called the talk boring herself before she even began). <em><a href="/blog/2016/review-jon-schwabish-better-presentations">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="review-lupi-posavec-dear-data" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2016/review-lupi-posavec-dear-data">Review: Lupi, Posavec, Dear Data</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#review-lupi-posavec-dear-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/review-lupi-posavec-dear-data&quot;&gt;Review: Lupi, Posavec, Dear Data&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec have turned their Dear Data project into a book. It&#39;s a great example of the kind of creative work you can do around visualization without computers, entirely by hand.

Menno-Jan Kraak&#39;s new book, Mapping Time: Illustrated by Minard&#39;s Map of Napoleon&#39;s Russian Campaign of 1812, discusses the historical context of Minard&#39;s work, his, life, and walks through a number of design exercises to show the same or similar data in different ways. <em><a href="/blog/2014/review-kraak-mapping-time">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="review-manuel-lima-the-book-of-trees" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2014/review-manuel-lima-the-book-of-trees">Review: Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#review-manuel-lima-the-book-of-trees" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2014/review-manuel-lima-the-book-of-trees&quot;&gt;Review: Manuel Lima, The Book of Trees&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Trees.

He doesn&#39;t tell him anything that&#39;s of interest and then dodges the question Who is Don Draper? by claiming that he was taught as a child not to talk about himself. Scientists do an equally terrible job at communication, and for many of the same reasons. Cornelia Dean&#39;s book Am I Making Myself Clear? offers fascinating insights into both journalism and science, and provides concrete ideas for how to do better. <em><a href="/blog/2010/cornelia-dean-am-i-making-myself-clear">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="book-review-visual-thinking-for-design-by-colin-ware" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking">Book Review: Visual Thinking for Design, by Colin Ware</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#book-review-visual-thinking-for-design-by-colin-ware" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking&quot;&gt;Book Review: Visual Thinking for Design, by Colin Ware&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Colin Ware&#39;s latest book Visual Thinking for Design has a promising subtitle: active vision, attention, visual queries, gist, visual skills, color, narrative, design. That&#39;s covering quite a bit of ground, and also a lot of things not usually considered in visualization. While this is a book about design, I was interested in what it could teach people in InfoVis, and I review it from that point of view. <em><a href="/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
