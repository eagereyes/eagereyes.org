It sounds silly, but I want to see where all my sales have ended up. Not for marketing purposes, just out of curiosity. I came across your zip scribble map in the process. It&#39;s very interesting and I must commend you for a new map of the USA. ðŸ˜ƒ thanks</p></blockquote><p>David saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>There&#39;s seems to be an error.</p><p>On my screen, I&#39;m seeing a box the width of the page, proportionately tall, yet 80% is blank white space while the map is in the top left hand corner, about 300px wide.</p><p>I&#39;m using FF 11.0 on Windows 7.</p></blockquote><p>David saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>I went to the polymaps website, and found the same error there, so it&#39;s apparently on their end. I checked in chrome and everything works fine. I&#39;ll give them a heads up.</p></blockquote><p>morri saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>Do you know TargetMap.com? I think it does exactly what you need, puts your customers into the map using your data with zip codes.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/111015555221260945577" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">patersonplankrd</a> saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>In some regards, the ZIP Code system makes sense per the state level. As well as in some large cities and those in very rural areas, However, I find puzzling is the assignment of Three digit Sectional Center codes. Some of these seem to be random. For example, In Eastern New York State, Orange County Zips are nearly all 109. However there is a small section of the county where the code is 127. Here&#39;s where it gets &quot;silly&quot;. To find adjacent , in numerical order,( i,e, 126, 127) codes one must travel well north of Albany to the far northeastern part of the state. I have searched many resources and cannot find any info as to how the USPS arrived at these assigned numbers. Nor can I find a methodology.</p></blockquote><p>Shelley J Cook saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>Not able to engage with the interactive zipscribble feature for the U.S. says, [raw] and then a big blank box.</p></blockquote><p>Mark Kumler saysâ€¦</p><blockquote><p>Still broken in August 2021.
