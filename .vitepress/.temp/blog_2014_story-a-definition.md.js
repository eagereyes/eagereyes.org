Lynn starts with the well-known ‚Äúshortest story ever‚Äù by Ernest Hemingway:</p><blockquote><p>For sale: baby shoes, never worn.</p></blockquote><p>It‚Äôs powerful stuff, and you can easily make up stories. Many of them may be sad, but I can actually think of positive stories too (the parents got too many shoes at a baby shower, they bought both boys and girls shoes and are selling the ones they don‚Äôt need, okay I‚Äôll stop now).</p><p>But the point is: this is not a story. There is no narrative, no characters, no conflict, no inciting incident, no arc, nothing. It‚Äôs not a story. It‚Äôs a situation, a vignette. It‚Äôs very evocative, and that clouds people‚Äôs judgment. But look at it again and tell me where you see the story. There is none, you get to make up your own.</p><p>Now let‚Äôs look at an actual story that isn‚Äôt much longer. It‚Äôs not as exciting, but it is a story:</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on April 06, 2014</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p><a href="http://gravatar.com/maptastik" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">maptastik</a> says‚Ä¶</p><blockquote><p>Note: I accidentally posted this on the wrong post a few days ago and just now noticed it. The sentiment stands though! üòÑ</p><p>Wow, you‚Äôre saying what I‚Äôve been unable to really articulate about the trend in web mapping to create ‚Äústory maps.‚Äù Stories have never meant foreclosing exploration. Fan-fiction comes to mind as an example of exploration spurred by an already articulated story. What I see in many story maps is a tendency to just put thematically related, but disjointed pieces of data and information on a map with the expectation that the viewer finds the (a?) story. That stories are implied and discoverable apparently means that there‚Äôs no need for the story maps author to actually write the story that prompted them to make the map in the first place! This, to me, is a frustrating mindset to deal with when, regarding stories, we‚Äôre talking about something that is really central to human civilization and culture.</p><p>Anyway, you‚Äôre definitely getting a mega-shout out in my presentation about story maps next month. This really opened up my mind about story and visualization,</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
