Also, you really need to get out from under that rock.</p><p>Anyway, the workshop <em><a href="http://thevcl.com/storytelling/">Telling Stories with Data</a></em> aims to bring together people who are interested in this topic, and want to discuss ideas, approaches, etc. They also have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Telling-Stories-with-Data-A-VisWeek-2010-workshop/137941022892330">facebook page</a> that you can subscribe to to get updates, even if you&#39;re only planning on attending without presenting.</p><p>The deadline for this workshop is <strong>August 4</strong>, they want a <strong>one-page abstract</strong> with bio, and you&#39;ll get <strong>20 minutes</strong> to present at the workshop.</p><h2 id="visual-analytics-in-health-care" tabindex="-1">Visual Analytics in Health Care <a class="header-anchor" href="#visual-analytics-in-health-care" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Visual Analytics in Health Care&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>While medical applications are huge in scientific visualization, they haven&#39;t really made their way into infovis and visual analytics. This workshop on <em><a href="http://research.ihost.com/vahc2010/">Visual Analytics in Health Care</a></em> is targeted at researchers working with medical records, on drug discovery, pandemic forecasting, etc.</p><p>The deadline is <strong>August 27</strong>, you can submit a paper with up to <strong>eight pages</strong>. Accepted submissions will be presented as <strong>posters or in oral presentations</strong>. Authors of selected papers will also be invited to submit to a special issue of the <em>Information Visualization</em> journal.</p><h2 id="the-role-of-theory-in-information-visualization" tabindex="-1">The Role of Theory in Information Visualization <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-role-of-theory-in-information-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Role of Theory in Information Visualization&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Last, but certainly not least, is the important topic of theory in information visualization. The workshop I am organizing together with T.J. Jankun-Kelly and Chris Weaver is titled <a href="/infovis-theory-workshop"><em>The Role of Theory in Information Visualization</em></a>. We want to hear your thoughts on what constitutes theory in infovis, what questions we need to address, and how to do that.</p><p>We also stole the idea of setting up <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/VisWeek-2010-Workshop-The-Role-of-Theory-in-Information-Visualization/120203618025408">a facebook page</a> from the storytelling workshop. Thanks for the idea, guys!</p><p>The deadline for submissions for this workshop is <strong>August 2</strong>, with a limit of <strong>two pages</strong> for your abstract. We will select a number of submissions for <strong>three minute provocations</strong>, not full presentations. Selected authors will also be invited to submit to a special issue of a journal later.</p><hr><p>These are just the three workshops I know of.
