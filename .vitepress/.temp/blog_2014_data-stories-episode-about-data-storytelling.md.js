Alberto has written up <a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/04/annotation-narrative-and-storytelling.html">an entire posting about his thoughts</a> (and stolen my amazing screenshot). I also wrote my two recent storytelling posts (<a title="Stories Are Gateways Into Worlds" href="/blog/2014/stories-are-gateways-into-worlds">worlds and stories</a>, <a title="Story: A Definition" href="/blog/2014/story-a-definition">definition of story</a>) in preparation for this podcast.</p><p>The resulting discussion touched on a number of topics, and we covered a lot of ground. There is certainly more to be said, but this is a great starting point. We certainly had lots of fun recording it, and I think it will be interesting to listen to.</p><p>Some may be wondering why I&#39;m on the podcast again, since I&#39;ve been a guest a <a title="Listen To Me Dispense My Wisdom on the Data Stories Podcast!" href="/blog/2012/listen-dispense-wisdom-data-stories-podcast">few</a> <a title="Report from IEEE VIS 2013 in Atlanta, GA" href="/blog/2013/report-from-ieee-vis-2013-in-atlanta-ga">times</a> <a title="Data Stories Podcast: 2013 in Review, Outlook to 2014" href="/blog/2014/data-stories-podcast-2013-in-review-outlook-to-2014">before</a>.
