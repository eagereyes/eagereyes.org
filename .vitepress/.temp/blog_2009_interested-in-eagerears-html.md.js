Neither will I tell you what to do (or provide hosting or any kind of infrastructure), I simply want to make sure the site that you are planning is really what shows up on EagerEars. So we will have to negotiate a hand-over date and conditions to be met. In return, you get a free domain for about eight months and some free advertising from this site.</p><p>It&#39;s very easy to register a domain, but there is no simple way to discard it. While I can jump through some hoops to get it deleted, it will almost certainly be picked up by a spammer. So I&#39;d rather try to find somebody who can put it to some use, and maybe even help get an interesting website started.</p><p>So if you are interested, <a href="/contact">contact me</a>, and we&#39;ll discuss this via email.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on May 02, 2009</em></p></div>`);
