Everything else is secondary.</p><p>A lot of data comes from tables in reports. It has become something of a custom in recent years for government agencies to publish the tables in their reports as Excel files. I really don&#39;t get the point of doing this, as it&#39;s the same exact numbers that can be found in the report, anyway. And usually, it&#39;s only a handful of numbers per table. Here is a recent example from a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/may/21/ukcrime-police">crime report in the UK</a>:</p><p align="center"><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/media/2009/burglars.png" border="0" alt="Burglar data" width="550" height="331"></p><p>This table, called <em>Who Are The Burglars?</em> appears with others, like <em>What Do They Steal?</em> and <em>How Do They Get In?</em> These are all relevant questions, of course, but what if I want to draw new connections? Perhaps male burglars steal different things than female ones? Do younger people steal more? Is there a difference in how they get in between the different age groups, sexes, and repeat offenders?</p><p>None of that is possible with this data, because it&#39;s not raw. It has been pre-digested and what we get is a neatly arranged report. There&#39;s nothing wrong with a well-prepared report, of course, but providing the source data would make the report a starting point for further exploration, rather than the end product of the analysis.</p><p>A good example for how things should be done are the <a href="http://www.census.gov/main/www/pums.html">U.S. Census Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS)</a>. The data format is not exactly a joy to work with: it&#39;s fixed width, with 00 meaning something different than 000 or 0, but it&#39;s possible to parse it. The metadata is in PDF files, and not exactly directly accessible. But it&#39;s data. Hundreds of dimensions. Millions of data points. Beautiful, delicious, raw data. Exactly the stuff we need to use our visualization tools on, to explore and find interesting new connections.</p><p>Data.gov has inspired people around the world, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2009/may/28/barack-obama">and particularly in the UK</a>. The UK government is currently trying to figure out <a href="http://powerofinformation.wordpress.com/">how to build a kind of data.gov.uk</a>, and <a href="http://blogs.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digitalengagement/post/2009/05/22/Information-and-how-to-make-it-useful.aspx">how to make that as useful as possible</a>. This is an interesting process to watch, since there wasn&#39;t much public participation in data.gov&#39;s design. There are many valid questions about data formats, feeds, etc., but the key issue is really the rawness of the data. Everything else can be handled with tools and libraries.</p><p>Quite a bit of the current data on data.gov is in shape files. These are proprietary, and their geographical component isn&#39;t always that interesting. There are a number of libraries that can open these files, though, so it is quite easy to extract the tabular data and get it into a CSV file or similar. The same is true for some of the XML files, which would make more sense as CSV (and vice versa). Even the missing RSS feed was <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2009/05/22/keeping-eye-datagov/">taken care of by Sunlight Labs</a>.</p><p>Another question that has come up is whether such a site should be an index or a repository: link to the data hosted on a variety of websites, or provide it in a central place, perhaps with a common data model, bulk downloads, and even an API. I believe that data.gov is choosing the right middle ground here. Linking to data is much easier than hosting it, and especially trying to get it all into one data collection – a project that is guaranteed to lead to endless discussions about the correct taxonomy, data model, etc.</p><p>We all have our data models and ideas about the data, so any overarching be-all-end-all data model data.gov would choose would match nobody else&#39;s. It really makes more sense to leave that to the user. Of course, it would be great to be able to query all the data in one central place. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen. And given the choice between the current data.gov and the perfect model in five years, I know what I would pick.</p><p>But despite all the flaws, the inconsistencies, and things that could be done but haven&#39;t been, there is one key component that makes it all viable: it&#39;s data. Real, raw, original data. Data we can use and <a href="http://had.co.nz/thesis/">melt and recast</a> and analyze. That&#39;s the kind of data that is worth going to all the trouble for. If we don&#39;t get that kind of data, all the other issues are moot.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on June 04, 2009</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://jeromecukier.net" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jerome Cukier</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>From a data visualization expert point of view, you can&#39;t beat raw data. </p><p>But one ambition of data.gov was to make data available to new audiences.</p><p>My guess is that a person who only needs a data-backed answer to a simple question won&#39;t be too happy to get raw data only. </p><p>don&#39;t get me wrong, I think it&#39;s great that raw data is becoming easier to obtain, but it&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be the one and only way to publish data.</p></blockquote><p>Robert Kosara says…</p><blockquote><p>I agree, and data.gov is really only usable for a small minority of people.
