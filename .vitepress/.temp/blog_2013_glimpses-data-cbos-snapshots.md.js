The usual way of doing this is through reports that are prepared on a variety of topics.</p><p><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43982">Snapshots</a> are like tweets: they contain a small amount of information, but are crisp, to the point, easy to consume, and link to more in-depth information to be found elsewhere.</p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43983"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2274" alt="Snapshot of Unemployment Benefits" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/43983-land-UI.png" width="600" height="405"></a></p><p>The CBO does not make policy recommendations, which makes creating charts with a purpose and message a much bigger challenge.
