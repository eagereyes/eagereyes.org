But mostly, he talked about curiosity.</p><p>When I wrote my <a title="VIS 2014 – Tuesday" href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-tuesday">IEEE VIS report for Tuesday</a> of that week, I knew that I could either do a shoddy job of describing the keynote and get the posting done, or have to push the entire thing back by a few days. So I decided to turn this into a separate posting.</p><p>The goal of writing up the talk here is not to provide a full recap – even though I could probably give the talk for him now, having seen variations of it three times in as many months. Instead, I want to pick out a few topics I find particularly interesting and universally relevant.</p><h2 id="curiosity" tabindex="-1">Curiosity <a class="header-anchor" href="#curiosity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Curiosity&quot;">​</a></h2><p>He started the talk with questions his kids ask him, like one from his 7-year-old daughter: <em>why don’t planets stop spinning?</em> That’s an amazingly deep question when you think about it, and even more so for a 7-year-old.</p><p>Alberto then went through some explanations, at the end of which he drew an interesting comparison: he likened the momentum of a planet’s rotation to the way answers can set his daughter’s mind in motion to produce more questions. Both keep spinning unless there’s a force to slow them down.</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8611" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cairo-motion-660x495.jpg" alt="Alberto Cairo, setting things in motion" width="660" height="495"></p><p>I particularly like the succinct way he put it: <em>Good answers lead to more good questions</em>. That sounds a lot like data analysis to me. And also to science. It’s quite satisfying to see a unifying theme between explanation and analysis: curiosity.</p><p>More knowledge leading to more questions is a fascinating idea. Cairo uses a quote by Ralph W. Sockman (also the basis for <a href="http://marcelogleiser.com/books/the-island-of-knowledge">a book by Marcelo Gleiser</a>), <em>The larger the island of knowledge, the longer the shoreline of wonder.</em> The island of knowledge is surrounded by an infinite <em>sea of mystery</em>. As the island grows, so does its shoreline, which is where wonder and new ideas happen.</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8609" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/cairo-island-of-knowledge-660x496.png" alt="Alberto Cairo, the island of knowledge" width="660" height="496"></p><p>I love this because it describes exactly the way science works. More knowledge always leads to more questions. Curiosity feeds itself. And it goes contrary to the idea that science takes away the mystery or beauty of nature by explaining things.</p><h2 id="it-s-more-complicated-than-that" tabindex="-1">It&#39;s More Complicated Than That <a class="header-anchor" href="#it-s-more-complicated-than-that" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;It&#39;s More Complicated Than That&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Getting back to journalism, Alberto lists a series of principles for a good visualization. It has to be…</p><ul><li>Truthful</li><li>Functional</li><li>Beautiful</li><li>Insightful</li><li>Enlightening</li></ul><p>This set of criteria is strongly based on journalistic practice and principles, and I think it makes a great package for the evaluation of any kind of visualization. Some of the criteria will look odd to the typical visualization person, such as the inclusion of beauty. But this is also what makes <a title="Review: Alberto Cairo, The Functional Art" href="/criticism/review-alberto-cairo-functional-art">Alberto&#39;s book</a> so useful in teaching visualization courses: it goes beyond the typical limited horizon of the technical and largely analytical (rather than communication-oriented) mindset that is still prevalent in visualization.</p><p>Another part of this section was my final take-away, another great little sentence that I think needs to be appreciated more when working with data: <em>it&#39;s more complicated than that</em>. Many times, it&#39;s hard to appreciate the complexity and complications in the data, especially when things look convincing and seem to all fit together. But simple explanations can often be misleading and hide a more complex truth. The curious mind keeps digging and asking more questions.</p><hr><p>Images from Alberto Cairo’s slides, which he kindly allowed me to use.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on January 04, 2015</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://www.manaskriti.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Vani Murarka</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>It is interesting that Alberto marks the shoreline of wonder as the edge of the island in the diagram. When I first read only the title of your post, I immediately visualized myself standing at the edge of the sea - the shoreline of wonder - and the island of knowledge is somewhere there in the middle of the sea. Marking the shoreline of wonder as the edge of the island itself indicates that reaching the shoreline of wonder one has already reached the island of knowledge! Both perspectives are fascinating. First, where one perceives two different landmasses - raises some further questions - maybe the two different landmasses is simply only just a perception and there <em>aren&#39;t</em> two landmasses. Second, as in the diagram above is simply beautiful - reaching the shoreline of wonder, you have reached the island of knowledge. And the more you focus on something, the more it grows (the island). Thanks for sharing a beautiful phrase. Am also so glad about Alberto&#39;s requirement of beauty. Beauty has its own way of creating pathways through membranes that separate perceptions / mindsets thereby adding tremendous power to the communication of the message.</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
