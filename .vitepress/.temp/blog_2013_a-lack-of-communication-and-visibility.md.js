What if you wanted to know what’s going on in visualization, and get a sense of what current work is the most interesting? There is no resource for this that I’m aware of, but there should be.</p><p>I’m currently in Washington, D.C., where I spoke at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Visualization-DC/events/153228162/">DC Data Vis meetup</a> last night (that was not my main reason for coming, but it worked out nicely). One of the questions I got afterwards was from a journalist who wanted to know how he could follow developments in the field. I didn’t have a good answer.</p><h2 id="what-we-lack" tabindex="-1">What We Lack <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-lack" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What We Lack&quot;">​</a></h2><p>It’s a really interesting question because it highlights how bad we are as a field in communicating our research. Here are some ways you can currently follow what is going on in visualization. And yes, I will talk mainly about information visualization, but scientific visualization is doing much worse.</p><ul><li>You can read the journals. TVCG, InfoVis, CGF, CG&amp;A. Of course to do that, you’ll need subscriptions to all of them, or access to three different digital libraries (IEEE, Eurographics, and Sage). Not exactly ideal. And then, you just get all the papers, but no curation or context. Which of these are really new stuff, which are just minor improvements of existing work? Also, you’re missing all the relevant work in HCI, cognitive psychology, etc., but there is no way you’re going to read all those journals to pick out what’s relevant.</li><li>You can go to conferences, like IEEE VIS and EuroVis. That way, you’ll see presentations and you’ll be able to talk to researchers and people in the field. But aside from the time commitment and expense, each of these only happens once a year. What do you do the rest of the year?</li><li>You can read blogs. I’ve written <a href="/tag/conference">summaries of conferences</a> and the <a href="/section/papers">odd posting about particular papers</a> (though mostly my own). But the conference summaries tend to only flag papers and give very little context. In addition, you can wait for <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/">Stephen Few</a> to rip a paper apart, but he also only does that once or twice a year, thankfully.</li><li>Set a Google Scholar alert. Those are really hit-or-miss, though, and it’s very difficult to pick good keywords to match, so you don’t miss too much but also don’t get completely inundated with irrelevant stuff.</li></ul><p>And that’s really it. At least, I can’t think of anything else.</p><h2 id="a-visualization-research-blog" tabindex="-1">A Visualization Research Blog <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-visualization-research-blog" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Visualization Research Blog&quot;">​</a></h2><p>What do we need? Here are some thoughts for the ideal visualization digest blog/website/service.</p><ul><li>Pick out interesting research. Somebody needs to make a judgment what work is worthy of discussion. That requires somebody with some knowledge of the field and its current directions.</li><li>Provide context. Just summarizing a paper is one thing, but pointing out similarities to and differences from other work make this much richer. This also requires somebody who knows the field.</li><li>Summarize and explain. The key is clearly to summarize the findings or ideas or techniques in a way that people can understand. That might mean writing, it might mean asking the authors for their prototype and using it on some data, etc. Making this worthwhile might require a considerable amount of work.</li><li>Keep feeding the pipeline. To keep a blog alive, you’d want to post at least one paper a week. You also need to have a pipeline set up, so that when the big VIS or EuroVis wave washes over you, you can fill it for the coming months, without overwhelming people with too many things at once.</li></ul> There is clearly a lot of value in doing this, but I wonder who could do it. Most academics don’t care enough and don’t have the time. There probably needs to be a way for this to make money, and I don’t know if advertising alone would do that (probably not). Perhaps somebody can make this a paid service, but I have no idea if there is enough of a market for this (most media outlets aren’t exactly swimming in money). <p>I really hope that somebody will do this, but I’m not holding my breath. What I will do, starting next year, is discuss more papers – both current ones and older ones. I’m not committing to a schedule here, but once a month seems like a reasonable rhythm. We’ll see how this works out. There’s certainly a lot of interesting work out there that would deserve a broader audience.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on December 10, 2013</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Andy says…</p><blockquote><p>Interesting idea. Does such a digest exist in other fields?</p></blockquote><p>Brian says…</p><blockquote><p>I think putting this together would be a real benefit, but also a real challenge. Practically speaking, perhaps the most likely to work approach would be an industry-academic partnership. Perhaps you could cast a somewhat wider net and include not just data visualization, but all visualization (cartography/mapping, scientific, etc.). See if you could find a set of sponsoring organizations, enough so the organization cost of sponsorship is relatively low, then try to get one or more universities involved as the source of labor. You would, I would think, want to target universities with good sized, and well-respected, visualization-related programs, especially graduate programs (as I figure grad students will probably be providing a lion&#39;s share of the leg work 😉. They would need to have faculty members willing and able to participate in some of the comparative and selective work. Consider only peer-reviewed work, or have two categories, clearly separated, between peer-reviewed and non-peer work.</p><p>Now, there are probably a whole host of potential ethical and political gotchas here, and the logistical issues are pretty daunting. That said, these kinds of groups are put together for many purposes, so it could be done. Whether you could get any industry buy-in absent some kind of economc benefit (e.g., competitive advantage to membership, disadvantage to lack of membership, reduced costs because a third party is now providing a service that used to be done by in-house personnel, etc.) is uncertain.</p><p>Like the concept though.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/chezvoila" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Voilà Info Design (@chezvoila)</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>I think Robert Kosara would be perfect for the job. Who else follows research and engages online so... eagerly?</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://research.fbeck.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Fabian Beck</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>What about starting a journal for that, including those recensions, comments, viewpoint articles and the like? It needs good peer review, but other reviewing standards than usual journals. I think other fields have an academic culture more open to these kinds of publications.</p><p>I&#39;ve written a couple of summary articles and conference reports for <a href="http://softvis.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://softvis.wordpress.com</a>, but it&#39;s really much work and there is no direct academic credit for that. Sad to say that, but writing another is usually not rated highest on my priority list.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/ndiakopoulos" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nick Diakopoulos (@ndiakopoulos)</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>It&#39;s interesting that a journalist asked you this, because typically it would be <em>their</em> job to develop an information feed and resources for following a field they&#39;re covering.</p><p>But actually I am a big fan of experts doing more public-facing communication about their niches, and looking forward to your upcoming coverage - it&#39;s also something I&#39;m trying to do.</p><p>I think you put your finger on the important question though: how to fund? I could see an academic outlet that has strength in both visualization and journalism collaborating to build an outlet using student labor (overseen by editors) to go the non-profit route. Or there are other models out there that seem to be successful for translating research into blog posts: <a href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://crowdresearch.org/blog/</a></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/timelyportfolio" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">klr (@timelyportfolio)</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>One example that immediately came to my mind was the CFA Digest <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/dig/2013/43/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://www.cfapubs.org/toc/dig/2013/43/3</a> for finance.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.cvast.tuwien.ac.at/~bilal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bilal Alsallakh</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Good point, Robert.
