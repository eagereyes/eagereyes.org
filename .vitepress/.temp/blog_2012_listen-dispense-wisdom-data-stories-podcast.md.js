You should really do the latter, so you won&#39;t miss episodes in the future. Another thing to do, once you&#39;ve listened to the latest episode, is to go through the archive and listen to some of the previous episodes with guests like Andy Kirk, Jeff Heer, and Alberto Cairo.</p><p>We talked about many different topics, including how I got started with visualization, how this website got started (and my crazy ideas for what I wanted to do), how blogging can help your tenure case, my move to Tableau, research at Tableau, and a lot of other things I can&#39;t even remember. We had a lot of fun, and I think we made some good points.</p><p>A bit of context to some of the things we talk about in the episode:</p><ul><li>I cite <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Arnheim">Rudolf Arnheim</a> as one of my influences. His books, <em>The Power of the Center</em>, <em>Visual Thinking</em>, and <em>Art and Visual Perception</em> are highly recommended.</li><li>Everything you need to know about blur for visualization can be found in these two papers: <a href="/publications/Kosara_InfoVis_2001.html"><em>Semantic Depth of Field</em></a> and <em><a href="/publications/Kosara_VisSym_2002.html">Useful Properties of Semantic Depth of Field for Better F+C Visualization</a></em></li><li>We mention <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> as a great way to get started blogging rather than wasting time, but I also recommend <a href="http://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>. You really can&#39;t go wrong with either.</li><li>eagereyes is, indeed, over six years old. I wrote <a title="Five Years of EagerEyes" href="/blog/2011/five-years-of-eagereyes">a posting on its fifths birthday last year</a>, but somehow forgot to do that this year. I registered the domain on August 12, 2004, the first posting is from October 1, 2006 (which is what I consider its birthday). So I screwed around for over a year before settling on the eventual content management system and blog format (I describe early ideas and what I want to do in the podcast).</li><li>And, of course, xkcd.</li></ul><p><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2107" title="xkcd: Duty Calls" alt="" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/duty_calls.png" width="300" height="330"></a></p><p>But don&#39;t forget to <a href="http://datastori.es/episode-15-with-robert-kosara/">listen to the actual podcast</a>!</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on December 09, 2012</em></p></div>`);
