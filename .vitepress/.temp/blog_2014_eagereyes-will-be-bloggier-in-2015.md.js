In addition to a new theme, I&#39;ve also been thinking about content. Here are some thoughts on what I want to do in 2015.</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it is, but I always start hating my website theme after about a year. We&#39;ll see if this one is any different. Either way, it&#39;s new. If you&#39;re curious, this is the new <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Twenty_Fifteen"><em>Twenty Fifteen</em> Theme</a> that&#39;s part of WordPress 4.1, with some minor tweaks. It&#39;s nice, simple, clean, and has a few subtle little features.</p><p>It&#39;s also decidedly a blog theme, with a focus on images. I&#39;ve been using teaser images for most postings for a while now, and will make a bigger effort to find good and fitting ones. These may not even show up in your newsreader, especially for link posts (though you will see them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eagereyes.org">facebook</a> and in the <a href="http://twitter.com/eagereyes_feed">Twitter cards</a>). But they make the site a lot nicer to look at and navigate.</p><p>As for content, there are mainly two things. One is that I want to make some more use of the post formats in WordPress, in particular links. These are different in that their title link goes to the page I want to link to, rather than a posting. The text that goes with each will also be short, so you&#39;ll be able to see the entire thing on the front page. If you care to comment, you can click on the image to go to the posting page.</p><p>I already <a title="Data Stories starring Tamara Munzner" href="/blog/2014/data-stories-starring-tamara-munzner">posted the first one</a> recently, and have a few more scheduled for the coming weeks. The idea is to post a few of these a month, in addition to the regular content. If you&#39;re <a href="http://twitter.com/eagereyes">following me on Twitter</a>, it&#39;s likely that you will have seen these links there before, but there will be a tad more context here, and there won&#39;t be nearly as many.</p><p>As for the other content, my plan is to make a clearer distinction between blog postings and articles. I already have that in the way the categories are set up, but that isn&#39;t very visible. I&#39;m aiming for more consistent posting (i.e., one posting a week, every week), with the blog postings being shorter and more informal, while the articles will be longer and more organized.</p><p>Link titles will start with &quot;Link:&quot; from now on, but I don&#39;t want to do that for blog postings or articles. I&#39;m not sure yet how I will indicate the distinction, but it should at least be clear from the length and maybe the tone.</p><p>The goal is to make the content easier to consume, since I know that anything beyond a few paragraphs is much less likely to be read in its entirety (or at all). And perhaps I&#39;ll even find a use for those other post types, like <em>quote</em>, <em>image</em>, and <em>aside</em>.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on December 29, 2014</em></p></div>`);
