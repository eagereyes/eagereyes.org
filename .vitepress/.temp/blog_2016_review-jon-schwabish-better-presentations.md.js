Badly thought-out slides, boring structure, poorly delivered. I once told a colleague after a practice talk to please shoot me before she’d ever make me sit through such a talk again (to be fair, she had called the talk boring herself before she even began).</p><p>Instead of suffering through more bad presentations, <a href="https://policyviz.com">Jon Schwabish</a> decided to teach people how to make them better with his book, <a href="https://policyviz.com/better-presentations/"><em>Better Presentations</em></a>. And it’s badly needed.</p><p>Jon covers both constructing the presentation (structure and slides) and delivering it. The latter is often neglected. Many people spend lots of time on their slides, but <a href="/blog/2016/common-speaking-mistakes-to-avoid">never bother to rehearse their talk or think of good openings and endings</a>.</p><p>Along the way, you learn many useful tricks for preparing figures for slides (including many interesting points about the difference between figures to use in a paper versus a presentation), using text and images, etc. There are also some good points about combining text and images. I generally avoid text as much as I possibly can, often using single images on my slides. But now I’m thinking I might need to include a bit more text as well (I realize that this is the opposite problem of most people, though).</p><p>One bit he buries a bit in the introduction is what he calls the audience-centric approach. It’s clearly at the core of everything he talks about, but he doesn’t make it a clear and explicit point. The mantra he proposes is also a bit long-winded and not very mantra-able. Instead, I propose this one:</p><blockquote><p>It’s for the audience, not for you!</p><p>It’s for the audience, not for you!</p><p>It’s for the audience, not for you!</p></blockquote><p>The book is organized around three principles that are easy to get behind: <em>visualize</em>, <em>unify</em>, and <em>focus</em>. Jon uses those repeatedly in each chapter and ends each with a short summary centered around them.</p><p>While much of the book talks about slides, Jon suggests creating the structure and flow of the presentation away from your presentation program. Just doing that is a big step in the right direction. He also has some good ideas about structuring the presentation in a way that is both interesting and not entirely opposite the usual academic-style presentation.</p><p><em>Better Presentations</em> is a helpful guide for anybody who regularly gives talks based on research. Or anybody who gives any kind of presentation, really.</p><hr><p>Jonathan Schwabish, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0231175213/"><em>Better Presentations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks</em></a>.
