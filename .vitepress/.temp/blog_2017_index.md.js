In a paper to be published at EuroVis next week, with Jessica Hullman at UW and my Tableau Research colleague Heidi Lam, we report on a pair of studies that looked into this. <em><a href="/blog/2017/paper-finding-a-clear-path-structuring-strategies-for-visualization-sequences">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="infovis-papers-at-chi-2017" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/infovis-papers-at-chi-2017">InfoVis Papers at CHI 2017</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#infovis-papers-at-chi-2017" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/infovis-papers-at-chi-2017&quot;&gt;InfoVis Papers at CHI 2017&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The two main conferences in visualization are VIS and EuroVis, but recently CHI has also gotten some very interesting submissions (CHI is technically a conference about human-computer interaction, or HCI).

It also contains the most confusing chart produced by the ISOTYPE Institute I am aware of. <em><a href="/blog/2017/isotype-book-priestley-british-women-go-to-war">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="sonification-the-power-the-problems" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/sonification-the-power-the-problems">Sonification: The Power, The Problems</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#sonification-the-power-the-problems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/sonification-the-power-the-problems&quot;&gt;Sonification: The Power, The Problems&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Sonification turns data into sound, just like visualization turns data into pictures. Except it&#39;s a lot more complicated and limited. Something about sonification has always bugged me, and I think I&#39;ve finally figured out what: the crowding on the time axis. I&#39;ve also recently discovered some of the powers of sonification, though. <em><a href="/blog/2017/sonification-the-power-the-problems">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="encoding-vs-decoding" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/encoding-vs-decoding">Encoding vs. Decoding</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#encoding-vs-decoding" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/encoding-vs-decoding&quot;&gt;Encoding vs. Decoding&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Visualization techniques encode data into visual shapes and colors. We assume that what the user of a visualization does is decode those values, but things aren’t that simple. <em><a href="/blog/2017/encoding-vs-decoding">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="come-to-my-talk-at-uw-on-tuesday-february-21" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/come-to-my-talk-at-uw-on-tuesday-february-21">Come To My Talk At UW On Tuesday, February 21</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#come-to-my-talk-at-uw-on-tuesday-february-21" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/come-to-my-talk-at-uw-on-tuesday-february-21&quot;&gt;Come To My Talk At UW On Tuesday, February 21&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I&#39;m giving a public lecture next Tuesday, February 21, at the University of Washington (UW). This is at the invitation of Professor Karen Cheng at the School of Art + Art History + Design. I will talk about what we know and what we don&#39;t know about visualization, and how we can expand our knowledge. <em><a href="/blog/2017/come-to-my-talk-at-uw-on-tuesday-february-21">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="hans-rosling-an-appreciation" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/hans-rosling-an-appreciation">Hans Rosling: An Appreciation</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#hans-rosling-an-appreciation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/hans-rosling-an-appreciation&quot;&gt;Hans Rosling: An Appreciation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Hans Rosling died earlier today (Tuesday, February 7). He championed the idea of showing people what the world was really like – and how it was different from their preconceptions – using data and visualization. And he did it with enthusiasm and humor. This is a brief appreciation of his work and legacy. <em><a href="/blog/2017/hans-rosling-an-appreciation">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="let-s-crowd-fund-the-data-stories-podcast" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/lets-crowd-fund-the-data-stories-podcast">Let’s Crowd-Fund the Data Stories Podcast!</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#let-s-crowd-fund-the-data-stories-podcast" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/lets-crowd-fund-the-data-stories-podcast&quot;&gt;Let’s Crowd-Fund the Data Stories Podcast!&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Enrico and Moritz, the two hosts of the only visualization podcast in the known universe, are trying to crowd-fund their work rather than rely on advertising.

There have also been some gaps, however, notably around storytelling. How far have we come, and where is visualization going? <em><a href="/blog/2017/the-state-of-information-visualization-2017">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="isotype-book-mackenzie-the-vital-flame" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/mackenzie-the-vital-flame">ISOTYPE Book: Mackenzie, The Vital Flame</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#isotype-book-mackenzie-the-vital-flame" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/mackenzie-the-vital-flame&quot;&gt;ISOTYPE Book: Mackenzie, The Vital Flame&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The first book in the new series on ISOTYPE books is The Vital Flame by Compton Mackenzie, published by The British Gas Council in 1947.

Otto and Marie Neurath created ISOTYPE in the 1920s and then ran their ISOTYPE Institute for more than two decades. During that time, they created charts for a wide variety of publications. In this series, I will show a number of these charts that I have found, and discuss the context they appeared in. <em><a href="/blog/2017/intro">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="posters-program-for-tapestry-2017" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2017/posters-program-for-tapestry-2017">Posters Program for Tapestry 2017</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#posters-program-for-tapestry-2017" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2017/posters-program-for-tapestry-2017&quot;&gt;Posters Program for Tapestry 2017&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The Fifth Tapestry conference for storytelling with data is only about six weeks away.
