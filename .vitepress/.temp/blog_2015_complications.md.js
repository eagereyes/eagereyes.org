They use many watch terms, even where they don&#39;t really make sense – like <em>movement</em> for the watch core CPU (which has no moving parts and does way more than a typical movement that just moves the hands).</p><p>One of the terms that they use is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_(horology)"><em>complications</em></a>. They nicely illustrate the idea in an image <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/timekeeping/">on their website</a>.</p><p align="center"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8739" src="https://media.eagereyes.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/complications.png" alt="Complications" width="660" height="410"></p><p>Among the <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/timekeeping/#complications">Watch&#39;s complications</a> are tiny widgets that show the current temperature, a stock price, the wearer&#39;s activity level, etc. They can be turned on and selected by the user.</p><p>What does this have to do with visualization or user interfaces? I think there is a deep cleverness in calling these things <em>complications</em> beyond just the cutesy superficial one.</p><p>Anything that does not serve the basic function of a watch, user interface, or visualization should be called a <em>complication</em>. That doesn&#39;t mean it needs to be removed. After all, complications can make a watch unique and useful. But it needs to be questioned. It needs to be examined and weighed against the distraction and clutter it causes.</p><p>In a watch, it&#39;s clear what its central function is. That is often not nearly as clear in an application or a visualization. But thinking about it in terms of complications might help: if I remove this element/button/label/data series, does it still work? If it does, do I still want to keep the element?</p><p>This is similar to the idea that design is about reducing things to their minimal functional and aesthetic core. Thinking of design elements as complications rather than in strict terms like <a href="/blog/2013/definition-chart-junk">the data-ink ratio</a> turns the question from a supposed rule to one of figuring out the trade-offs. And those can be quite different depending on the goals and the context. A useless item in one might be crucial to understanding a piece or engage an audience in another.</p><p><em>Complications</em> as a concept is nice because it opens up a conversation. It moves us beyond supposedly strict and straightforward rules that seem to be set in stone. Many things are more complicated than that.</p><hr><p><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Greubel_Forsey_Invention_Piece_1.jpg">Teaser image from Wikimedia</a>, used under creative commons.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on March 22, 2015</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="http://gravatar.com/juddbradbury" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">juddbradbury</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>Yes a great conversation! I immediately started thinking the data-ink ration as well. But then there is the emergence of complications as intellectual triggers that engage system 1 cognition versus the system 2 heuristic. Complications might be an opportunity. I prefer clean aesthetics but I might prefer them because I do not have to think about them. Maybe we want to pull the think trigger sometimes.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/662722923" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jérôme Cukier</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>another interesting reason for using this term is that complications is what drives the price of fine watches up. if clockmakers can fit a number of complications in a very space constrained watch, this is a feat of virtuosity and the watch, a grande complication, becomes a work of art. for us in the visualization or ux space, since there are much fewer technical limitations, there is typically no value in adding unwanted features - it is not impressive to do so. however, if we consider the constraint of a display to be: balance, legibility, ease of use, elegance; and the novelty to be: not necessarily an additional feature, but a different way to represent the information, then yes, these new displays are very much like fine complications.</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
