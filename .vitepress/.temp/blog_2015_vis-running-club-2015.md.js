As with previous years, organization will be minimal: just show up ready to run. I will prepare routes in the 3-6mi (5-10km) range.</p><p>If you want to know what being organized looks like, check out the <a href="http://www.gicentre.net/velo-club-de-vis/">Velo Club de VIS:</a> they have a website, a meetup, fancy bikes, a hashtag, and probably a selfie drone or two.</p><p>For the runs, let&#39;s just meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30am on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. We can decide to also run on Friday, but I&#39;m going to keep that one optional, so check with me before (unless you want to go on your own).</p><p>For the routes, I will look at where people run on Strava. However, I suspect that we&#39;ll simply go out to the lake and run along there. That seems like the obvious option, and we might get a glimpse of a pretty sunrise there.</p><p>We did this the first time last year at <a href="/blog/2014/vis-2014-monday">VIS</a>, and it was a lot of fun to run around Paris in the dark. I also tried it at <a href="/blog/2015/report-eurovis-2015">EuroVis</a>, but it was mostly just Stephen Kobourov and me. It was a great way to see some more of Cagliari though.</p><p>So pack your shoes and shorts (and maybe some warm running clothes and a beanie/tuque) and join us! I know it&#39;s early but it&#39;s really the only time that works with all the parties and dinners and things planned for the nights.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 15, 2015</em></p></div>`);
