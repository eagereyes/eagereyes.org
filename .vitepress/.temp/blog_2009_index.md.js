While my analysis may not be as pretty and flashy as Fry&#39;s, it provides actual insight into the data. It also reveals an interesting issue: the data is really dull.

The data is all well and good, but the real value comes from visualizing it. Why visualize your mundane, boring life?

One of the goals of the Putting Visualization on the Web workshop was to get more visualization blogs and websites going. So here are some pointers and a few tips on how to avoid some pitfalls that are especially dangerous for technical people. The goal is not to point to millions of resources, but to narrow down the choices so you can get started writing. <em><a href="/blog/2009/starting-your-own-visualization-blog">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visweek-preview-changing-the-world-with-visualization-panel" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/visweek-changing-the-world-with-visualization-panel">VisWeek Preview: Changing the World with Visualization (Panel)</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visweek-preview-changing-the-world-with-visualization-panel" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/visweek-changing-the-world-with-visualization-panel&quot;&gt;VisWeek Preview: Changing the World with Visualization (Panel)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>What good is visualization if it can&#39;t save the world? Or maybe at least change it. Make it a little better. Make a difference. I am organizing a panel at InfoVis next week to discuss what visualization already does, and what else we can do to free visualization from the confines of the ivory tower and have an impact in the real world.

Alas, this is not actually the case. To most people, visualization means pretty pictures first, and maybe also a fact or two. We have to fight that or risk the trivialization and marginalization of visualization as an analytic tool. <em><a href="/blog/2009/shaking-the-pretty-picture-stigma">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="qnch-a-data-description-language-for-tabular-data" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/qnch-data-description-language-for-tabular-data">qnch - A Data Description Language for Tabular Data</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#qnch-a-data-description-language-for-tabular-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/qnch-data-description-language-for-tabular-data&quot;&gt;qnch - A Data Description Language for Tabular Data&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A lot of data is tabular in nature, and is efficiently encoded in text files. While such files are easy to produce and read, they bring with them several challenges when used in visualization tools and other programs that have to understand some of the data&#39;s properties. Examples include categorical data, special values in numerical columns (which are common in Census data), and information about the data like its producer. Here is a proposal for a simple data description format that provides that missing information. I call it qnch. <em><a href="/blog/2009/qnch-data-description-language-for-tabular-data">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="parallel-sets-2-1-released" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/parallel-sets-2-1-released">Parallel Sets 2.1 Released</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#parallel-sets-2-1-released" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/parallel-sets-2-1-released&quot;&gt;Parallel Sets 2.1 Released&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We are happy to announce the release of Parallel Sets 2.1. The new version fixes a number of bugs and introduces a few new features. The biggest changes are under hood, with a new database model that can now handle much more complex datasets (in terms of number of dimensions and categories), and the new streaming import can load in datasets with a much larger number of records. We have also added a way to automatically sort categories by name and size, a screenshot function, and more. Upgrading is strongly recommended. <em><a href="/blog/2009/parallel-sets-2-1-released">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="oecd-seminar-on-turning-statistics-into-knowledge" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/oecd-seminar-turning-statistics-into-knowledge">OECD Seminar on Turning Statistics into Knowledge</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#oecd-seminar-on-turning-statistics-into-knowledge" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/oecd-seminar-turning-statistics-into-knowledge&quot;&gt;OECD Seminar on Turning Statistics into Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Last week, I attended the seminar on Turning Statistics into Knowledge, organized by the OECD, the World Bank, and the US Census Bureau. That was an interesting way of spending two days, and I saw some interesting ideas and talked to many great people. But it was also a reminder of how little understanding of visualization there really is, and how far we have to go to make good visualizations available and work for a variety of users. <em><a href="/blog/2009/oecd-seminar-turning-statistics-into-knowledge">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="looking-for-parallel-sets-users-with-real-data" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/parsets-users-with-real-data">Looking for Parallel Sets Users with Real Data</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#looking-for-parallel-sets-users-with-real-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/parsets-users-with-real-data&quot;&gt;Looking for Parallel Sets Users with Real Data&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>We are looking for people who use Parallel Sets with real-world data and who would be interested in taking part in writing up a case study for the InfoVis Discovery Exhibition. You don&#39;t have to share your data, and the images can be anonymized, but it has to be real data (and you have to be able to describe what it is and what you learned in a way that is not too general). <em><a href="/blog/2009/parsets-users-with-real-data">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="putting-visualization-on-the-web-–-at-visweek-2009" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/putting-visualization-on-the-web-visweek">Putting Visualization on the Web – at VisWeek 2009</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#putting-visualization-on-the-web-–-at-visweek-2009" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/putting-visualization-on-the-web-visweek&quot;&gt;Putting Visualization on the Web – at VisWeek 2009&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A while ago, I complained about the state of visualization on the web. To improve things, I am co-organizing a workshop at VisWeek in October to discuss the status quo, potential problems, and to find new ways to get visualization people to make their mark online. Whether you have a blog or website, don&#39;t have a blog or website, plan on starting one, are afraid of starting one, or think this whole web thing is just a fad – we want to hear from you! <em><a href="/blog/2009/putting-visualization-on-the-web-visweek">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-browser-for-data-gov" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/data-gov-browser">A Browser for Data.gov</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-browser-for-data-gov" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/data-gov-browser&quot;&gt;A Browser for Data.gov&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Data.gov&#39;s selection of data is slowly growing, but even with less than 300 datasets, it is difficult to keep an overview of what is there. Below is a little Java applet that provides a way to drill down into data.gov&#39;s catalog using a variety of categories: reporting agency, geographic coverage, frequency, data type, etc. Besides giving a better idea what is there, it also shows a number of inconsistencies that make finding data more difficult. <em><a href="/blog/2009/data-gov-browser">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="data-is-a-dish-best-served-raw" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/dish-best-served-raw">Data Is A Dish Best Served Raw</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-is-a-dish-best-served-raw" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/dish-best-served-raw&quot;&gt;Data Is A Dish Best Served Raw&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The recent opening of Data.gov has led to a number of discussions on data formats, feeds, what kinds of data, which agencies are or are not participating, etc. One key aspect that gets overlooked very easily, but that is really essential, is that what is being published is actual data: original, raw, unprocessed, undigested, naked data. Everything else is secondary. <em><a href="/blog/2009/dish-best-served-raw">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="parallel-sets-released" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/parallel-sets-released">Parallel Sets Released!</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#parallel-sets-released" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/parallel-sets-released&quot;&gt;Parallel Sets Released!&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>After an initial commitment, an announcement, and a delay, we are proud to announce that the Parallel Sets application has been released!

The goal is to collect reports of visualization is used in real-world scenarios, and how visualization tools can help solve real problems. There are already two examples, and with enough participation, this should turn into a great resource.

It&#39;s a laudable effort, and there is quite a bit of data there, but it&#39;s still very labor-intensive to get the data sets and convert them into usable formats. But it&#39;s becoming clear that data needs to be shared, and that access to government data will soon be regarded as much as an inherent part of a democracy as free elections. <em><a href="/blog/2009/data-gov">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visualization-is-not-periodic-period" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/visualization-is-not-periodic-html">Visualization is not Periodic, Period!</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visualization-is-not-periodic-period" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/visualization-is-not-periodic-html&quot;&gt;Visualization is not Periodic, Period!&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Of all the sins committed against visualization on the Internet, the Periodic Table of Visualization Methods stands out as the most egregious. Its collection of actual visualization methods, structural diagrams, and feel-good business bullshit does not fit a structure that was devised to understand the world – and that is actually a very effective visualization in itself. <em><a href="/blog/2009/visualization-is-not-periodic-html">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="parallel-sets-release-pushed-back-a-bit-updated" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/parsets-delay-html">Parallel Sets Release Pushed Back A Bit (Updated)</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#parallel-sets-release-pushed-back-a-bit-updated" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/parsets-delay-html&quot;&gt;Parallel Sets Release Pushed Back A Bit (Updated)&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I&#39;m very sorry, but we have to delay the release. We need to make sure that we have the right to release the program, and this is taking a bit longer than expected. The software was written in part by students paid from the SRVAC, which is funded by DHS and DOE. It is unlikely that there will be a problem, but we don&#39;t have the go-ahead yet, either.

The reason is quite simply lack of time: the semester is ending here at UNC Charlotte, and things are rather busy as a result. There is also the nuts-and-bolts work of making this work as an application for end-users that works well on at least two platforms (Windows and Mac OS X), and that can provide useful information when it doesn&#39;t. <em><a href="/blog/2009/parallel-sets-release-date-html">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="design-tutorials-for-visweek-2009" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/design-tutorials-for-visweek-2009">Design Tutorials for VisWeek 2009</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#design-tutorials-for-visweek-2009" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/design-tutorials-for-visweek-2009&quot;&gt;Design Tutorials for VisWeek 2009&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As one of the Tutorials Chairs at this year&#39;s VisWeek (which is the combination of the IEEE Vis and InfoVis conferences, and the VAST symposium), I want to make you aware of the upcoming deadline for submitting tutorial proposals: April 28.

Looking around, I don&#39;t see a lot of good, affordable (or free) visualization software. There are lots of papers, but few of those programs are available. And those that are often are of very low quality, very limited in their functionality, and are not being maintained. Please help me collect links to visualization tools that let people with data experience that visualization magic. <em><a href="/blog/2009/where-are-the-visualization-tools">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="new-sister-site-eagerears-org" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/new-sister-site-eagerears">New Sister Site: EagerEars.org</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-sister-site-eagerears-org" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/new-sister-site-eagerears&quot;&gt;New Sister Site: EagerEars.org&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Music and visualization are two things that fascinate me. I always felt that they had something in common, and I recently figured out what it was: structure. That may not be the correct musical term, but it should be clear what I mean nonetheless: the rhythmic structure of music, with its repeated patterns and variations, is what makes music. And that is also what makes abstract images interesting to look at, and what we look for in visualization. So I decided to start another website for my musings on music: EagerEars. <em><a href="/blog/2009/new-sister-site-eagerears">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="shining-a-light-on-data-florence-nightingale" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/shining-a-light-on-data-florence-nightingale">Shining a Light on Data: Florence Nightingale</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#shining-a-light-on-data-florence-nightingale" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/shining-a-light-on-data-florence-nightingale&quot;&gt;Shining a Light on Data: Florence Nightingale&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Florence Nightingale invented modern nursing, and established its importance based on data she collected during the Crimean War in the 19th century. She was not only the first one to realize the role of hygiene and care for wounded soldiers to prevent the spread of disease and death, she also was the first to understand that sound decisions can only be made on data. Not only did she collect that data, she also devised ways to communicate it to decision makers who lacked knowledge of statistics or math. <em><a href="/blog/2009/shining-a-light-on-data-florence-nightingale">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-spike-of-interest-in-parallel-sets" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/a-spike-of-interest-in-parallel-sets">A Spike of Interest in Parallel Sets</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-spike-of-interest-in-parallel-sets" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/a-spike-of-interest-in-parallel-sets&quot;&gt;A Spike of Interest in Parallel Sets&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A few days ago, Michael Blastland published a very interesting little article on the BBC Magazine website, in which he showed an image of Parallel Sets. He also mentioned my name and even though there was no link or email address, I have seen a spike in traffic on this website and my university page, and have gotten a barrage of emails from people who want to try it out. Here is some information on the technique and a plan for getting the tool out into the world. <em><a href="/blog/2009/a-spike-of-interest-in-parallel-sets">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="sightings-a-little-space-please" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/sightings-a-little-space-please">Sightings: A Little Space, Please!</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#sightings-a-little-space-please" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/sightings-a-little-space-please&quot;&gt;Sightings: A Little Space, Please!&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>&quot;InfoVis and SciVis face off&quot; is how the American Scientist homepage teases for my latest Sightings column. While the comparison between information visualization (InfoVis) and scientific visualization (SciVis) is part of the discussion, I am also describing work by my colleague Anthony Fodor (who works in bioinformatics) to demonstrate the usefulness of InfoVis in science. <em><a href="/blog/2009/sightings-a-little-space-please">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-national-data-agency" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/a-national-data-agency">A National Data Agency</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-national-data-agency" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/a-national-data-agency&quot;&gt;A National Data Agency&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>President Obama promises a more responsible and accountable government that openly shares information with its people. This includes publishing executive orders and laws before they are signed, so everybody can comment. But it also needs to include the data decisions are based on. An information society needs its data to be available and accessible to make informed decisions – just like its leaders. <em><a href="/blog/2009/a-national-data-agency">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-better-vis-web-community" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/a-better-vis-web-community">A Better Vis Web Community</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-better-vis-web-community" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/a-better-vis-web-community&quot;&gt;A Better Vis Web Community&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When I look around my little corner of the Internet, I see a few other people doing related stuff, but I also see a lot of unrealized potential. Why are there so few people in the visualization community who run a website? Why are the most popular visualization-related sites almost entirely about pointing at colorful pictures done by others, rather than doing their own? And how can we get more original, quality visualization content on the web? <em><a href="/blog/2009/a-better-vis-web-community">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
