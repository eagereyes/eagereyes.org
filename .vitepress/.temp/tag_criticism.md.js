But it is also a useful tool that shows the thinking behind the seemingly simple graphical shapes we use, and teaches people things they might not be aware of. While I largely agree with Andy Kirk&#39;s criticism of visualization criticism and the danger of scaring people away from visualization, his &quot;grown-up criticism&quot; argument cuts both ways: grown-ups can argue a point without getting upset. <em><a href="/blog/2012/criticism-visualization-criticism-criticism">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="quo-vadis-many-eyes" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2012/quo-vadis-many-eyes">Quo Vadis, Many Eyes?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#quo-vadis-many-eyes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2012/quo-vadis-many-eyes&quot;&gt;Quo Vadis, Many Eyes?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Remember when visualization for the masses was all the rage, back in 2007? We were so young and hopeful. Many Eyes and Swivel were the harbingers of a new age of data literacy and well-informed debate. Visualization was going to be social and change the world. Alas, it was not to last. Swivel is gone, and Many Eyes clearly seen its best days. This is despite the fact that interest in visualization is growing, and it turns out that Many Eyes is as busy now as never before. I have scraped some data from the site that shows that despite the lack of updates and new features, people&#39;s use of it is still increasing.

But they&#39;re not always a bad choice, and can work for simple data presentation. Context is important when criticizing visualizations, especially when there are no obvious improvements that can be made. <em><a href="/blog/2011/above-all-do-no-harm">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="in-defense-of-pie-charts" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2011/in-defense-of-pie-charts">In Defense of Pie Charts</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#in-defense-of-pie-charts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2011/in-defense-of-pie-charts&quot;&gt;In Defense of Pie Charts&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Pie charts don&#39;t get much respect. They&#39;re almost always considered the wrong choice by those supposedly in the know. But how do we know that this is true? What evidence do we have to support this? The truth is, not much.

A reader pointed me to a presentation (PDF) by the New Hampshire Department of Education that illustrates some of the thinking behind choosing a new visual representation.

Visualization also provides the context necessary to make better choices and to be more careful when fitting models.

You can discuss these questions at length, but without concrete criteria, they end up being academic exercises rather than leading to some kind of conclusion. One criterion, which I believe to be suited especially well for visualization, is the sublime. Art is sublime, visualization is not.

A paper that was presented at CHI recently described a study to figure out just how bad all this chart junk really was. As it turns out, it&#39;s actually rather helpful. <em><a href="/blog/2010/chart-junk-considered-useful-after-all">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-visualization-cargo-cult" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/the-visualization-cargo-cult">The Visualization Cargo Cult</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-visualization-cargo-cult" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/the-visualization-cargo-cult&quot;&gt;The Visualization Cargo Cult&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Visualization is not a very clearly defined field. There are many variations, ways of doing it, and ideas around it. That is valuable, because it keeps the field moving and brings in fresh ideas. But it also brings with it people who like using visualization&#39;s tools and talk about visualization, but what they are doing is something else. We need to start calling these things what they are: a cargo cult of visualization. <em><a href="/blog/2010/the-visualization-cargo-cult">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="march-chart-madness" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/march-chart-madness">March Chart Madness</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#march-chart-madness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/march-chart-madness&quot;&gt;March Chart Madness&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Terrible charts seem to be in season. Rarely have I come across so many incredibly bad charts in such a short time: information graphics that don&#39;t actually depict data, distorted representations, useless color schemes, and the worst pie chart ever. <em><a href="/blog/2010/march-chart-madness">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="data-visualization-should-we-divide-it" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/data-visualization-should-we-divide-it">Data Visualization: Should We Divide It?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-visualization-should-we-divide-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/data-visualization-should-we-divide-it&quot;&gt;Data Visualization: Should We Divide It?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For some time now there has been some discussion about finding a new terminology for the Data Visualization field. The intention is to find names that reflects the two main different directions that are seen today on Dataviz: visual data analysis and data driven aesthetics images. The concern is that Data Visualization might lose its ‘serious’ role as an analytic tool by including works that, without doubt, praise aesthetics before clarity. <em><a href="/blog/2010/data-visualization-should-we-divide-it">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="curing-a-sick-chart" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/curing-a-sick-chart">Curing A Sick Chart</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#curing-a-sick-chart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/curing-a-sick-chart&quot;&gt;Curing A Sick Chart&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I recently criticized Ben Fry&#39;s visualization of health care cost data from GE and claimed that I knew how to do it better. While my analysis may not be as pretty and flashy as Fry&#39;s, it provides actual insight into the data. It also reveals an interesting issue: the data is really dull. So dull, in fact, that a visualization was needed to cover up that fact. <em><a href="/blog/2009/curing-a-sick-chart">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-cost-of-a-sick-chart" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2009/cost-of-a-sick-chart">The Cost of a Sick Chart</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cost-of-a-sick-chart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2009/cost-of-a-sick-chart&quot;&gt;The Cost of a Sick Chart&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>General Electric recently commissioned Ben Fry and Seed Media to visualize health data to communicate the costs of different kinds of diseases to the public.

Alas, this is not actually the case. To most people, visualization means pretty pictures first, and maybe also a fact or two. We have to fight that or risk the trivialization and marginalization of visualization as an analytic tool. <em><a href="/blog/2009/shaking-the-pretty-picture-stigma">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="spss-viz-designer" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2008/spss-viz-designer">SPSS Viz Designer</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#spss-viz-designer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/spss-viz-designer&quot;&gt;SPSS Viz Designer&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>SPSS recently released their new Viz Designer, a visualization engine built on Leland Wilkinson&#39;s work (The Grammar of Graphics and nViZn). The comparison with Tableau is unavoidable since both are based on the same underlying ideas. Right now, Viz Designer does not look good in that comparison. <em><a href="/blog/2008/spss-viz-designer">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="what-is-visualization-a-definition" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2008/definition-of-visualization">What is Visualization?

A Definition&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>What is a visualization? The word is problematic, and there have been very few definitions that try to define this field we are working in. More importantly: what is not a visualization? It is easy to argue that anything visual is a visualization in some way – but does that mean anything? Here is a definition of visualization and a few examples to illustrate the different criteria. <em><a href="/blog/2008/definition-of-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="book-review-visual-thinking-for-design-by-colin-ware" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking">Book Review: Visual Thinking for Design, by Colin Ware</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#book-review-visual-thinking-for-design-by-colin-ware" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking&quot;&gt;Book Review: Visual Thinking for Design, by Colin Ware&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Colin Ware&#39;s latest book Visual Thinking for Design has a promising subtitle: active vision, attention, visual queries, gist, visual skills, color, narrative, design. That&#39;s covering quite a bit of ground, and also a lot of things not usually considered in visualization. While this is a book about design, I was interested in what it could teach people in InfoVis, and I review it from that point of view. <em><a href="/blog/2008/review-visual-thinking">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-tale-of-two-types-of-visualization-and-much-confusion" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/tale-of-two-types">A Tale of Two Types of Visualization and Much Confusion</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-tale-of-two-types-of-visualization-and-much-confusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/tale-of-two-types&quot;&gt;A Tale of Two Types of Visualization and Much Confusion&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The term visualization is used to mean different things in different contexts, and even visualization that is based on data can be done for different reasons and with different goals. Mixing up these different types of visualization leads to misunderstandings and confusion. Here is an attempt at teasing apart the two major types of data-based visualization, and understanding the differences. <em><a href="/blog/2007/tale-of-two-types">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="autism-diagnosis-accuracy-visualization-redesign" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/autism-diagnosis-accuracy">Autism Diagnosis Accuracy - Visualization Redesign</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#autism-diagnosis-accuracy-visualization-redesign" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/autism-diagnosis-accuracy&quot;&gt;Autism Diagnosis Accuracy - Visualization Redesign&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Kaiser at Junk Charts has posted an interesting challenge based on the question how to visualize an Autism diagnosis dataset in a better way (originally posted by Igor Carron at Nuit Blanche). I&#39;m offering my own redesign of the data below, and discuss my different approach and what it tells us about the visualization of sets in general. <em><a href="/blog/2007/autism-diagnosis-accuracy">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-science-of-information-visualization-a-sketch" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/sketch-of-infovis-science">The Science of Information Visualization: A Sketch</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-science-of-information-visualization-a-sketch" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/sketch-of-infovis-science&quot;&gt;The Science of Information Visualization: A Sketch&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>According to one definition(ref), engineering is making things based on scientific principles – as opposed to the intuitive making that defines a craft. Information visualization (InfoVis) is practiced like a craft today, based mostly on practical examples, but not on theoretical basics. Here is a sketch of not only InfoVis as an engineering field, but InfoVis as a science. <em><a href="/blog/2007/sketch-of-infovis-science">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-joy-of-representation" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/joy-of-representation">The Joy of Representation</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-joy-of-representation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/joy-of-representation&quot;&gt;The Joy of Representation&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When peanuts are bombs, clown-shaped cake ornaments are muzzle fires, and young guys are skateboards, we are talking about representation. We take it for granted that words can refer to things or abstract concepts, and colored spots on a piece of paper can depict data. Representation is really quite remarkable, and a better understanding of it will make a big difference in how we build visualizations. <em><a href="/blog/2007/joy-of-representation">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-critique-of-chernoff-faces" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/chernoff-faces">A Critique of Chernoff Faces</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-critique-of-chernoff-faces" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/chernoff-faces&quot;&gt;A Critique of Chernoff Faces&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Chernoff Faces are discussed in every information visualization course, and are referenced in many papers that talk about glyphs. Yet the only serious use of faces in visualization is for calibration, not for data display. Faces are so special that we better know their perceptual properties really well before we can use them, which we don&#39;t. <em><a href="/blog/2007/chernoff-faces">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="review-swivel-vs-many-eyes" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2007/swivel-vs-many-eyes">Review: Swivel vs. Many Eyes</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#review-swivel-vs-many-eyes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2007/swivel-vs-many-eyes&quot;&gt;Review: Swivel vs. Many Eyes&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Social websites are all the rage right now, and are not just hyped by the media (MySpace and YouTube in particular), but there are also large amounts of money involved (again, MySpace and YouTube). But does the social model make sense for data analysis and visualization? And will users play and interact with data the way they do with other media? Two websites were launched recently to find out: Swivel.com (defunct as of late 2010) and Many Eyes. Here is a first review, looking at the two sites in terms of their founders, approach, social aspects, technology, capabilities, broad appeal, and ethics. <em><a href="/blog/2007/swivel-vs-many-eyes">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2006/loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic">The Loneliness of the Visualization Critic</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic&quot;&gt;The Loneliness of the Visualization Critic&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>At a panel discussion at Vis 2006, we were blasted for raising the question, Is there Science in Visualization? A senior visualization researcher said that he was embarrassed that this question was being discussed, and that we were trying to push our way of doing things on the community. The panel was still a success, but this proved just how far we still have to go. <em><a href="/blog/2006/loneliness-of-the-visualization-critic">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="when-informative-art-isn-t" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2006/informative-art">When Informative Art Isn&#39;t</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-informative-art-isn-t" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/informative-art&quot;&gt;When Informative Art Isn&#39;t&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Making visualization more aesthetically pleasing is certainly an important goal. Another one is to make visualization a part of our everyday lives. Ambient information displays are a way of doing both, and they are often inspired by pieces of art. But what if the viewers think they are just looking at a picture, and don&#39;t realize that it presents information to them? <em><a href="/blog/2006/informative-art">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visualization-criticism-a-new-way-of-thinking-about-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2006/visualization-criticism">Visualization Criticism - A New Way of Thinking about Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visualization-criticism-a-new-way-of-thinking-about-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/visualization-criticism&quot;&gt;Visualization Criticism - A New Way of Thinking about Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The main means of communication in science is the (printed) journal article or conference paper, which only contains text and static images. This limits the way we can illustrate change, interaction, and dynamics. We do not have the appropriate language to effectively describe our work not only in terms of what it shows, but how and why it works. We also lack a means of talking about our own and others&#39; work in ways that critically reflect on what has been done. We need to learn from art criticism, where this is all possible. <em><a href="/blog/2006/visualization-criticism">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="opining-or-murmuring-infographics-vs-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2006/opining-or-murmuring">Opining or Murmuring: Infographics vs. Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#opining-or-murmuring-infographics-vs-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2006/opining-or-murmuring&quot;&gt;Opining or Murmuring: Infographics vs. Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Commenting on a diagram showing the flow of electricity from its production to its use (and waste), the author of the Junk Charts blog writes: As it stands, this chart murmurs but does not opine.
