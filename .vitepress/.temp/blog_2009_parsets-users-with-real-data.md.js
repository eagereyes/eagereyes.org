You will be listed as a co-author on the submission, and you get a warm fuzzy feeling from helping the visualization world see its potential impact in the real world. At some point in the future, i will also put together a showcase of uses for Parallel Sets on this site.</p><p>If you are interested, please <a href="/contact">drop me a line</a> with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of the kind of data you&#39;re using it with, and what you have learned from its use. For the actual submission, I will need around 500 words of description plus a few screenshots. I already have one co-author and am looking for one to two more. The deadline for submission is next week, but I will be traveling and will need to hear from you by this Friday (July 10).</p><p>The next version of Parallel Sets is in the works, and I hope to get it done this week. Things are fairly busy right now with proposal writing, and I have a few bugs to fix before I can release 2.1. But it will have a few new useful features, and be able to deal better with very high-dimensional data.</p><p>In unrelated site news, comments are now moderated again. I am getting around 50 spam comments a day at the moment, so there is unfortunately no way around this. I am trying to moderate new comments quickly, but it can take some time for them to be published.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on July 07, 2009</em></p></div>`);
