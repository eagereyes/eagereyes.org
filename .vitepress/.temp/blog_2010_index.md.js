One sentence I heard over and over was, &quot;this photo/visualization/illustration tells a great story.&quot; But pictures don&#39;t tell stories, people do. An image, a visualization, data, etc. can only be the material the story is made from.

Would it make sense to provide a textual representation? What about a representation that you can feel and touch, isn&#39;t that a visualization?

Bertin&#39;s ideas about marks and retinal variables have provided a great starting point, but we are now seeing their limitations. We need to turn a new page and move beyond those cosy, familiar ideas, into new territory. A recent paper by Caroline Ziemkiewicz and myself makes an argument why, and provides some possible directions. <em><a href="/blog/2010/beyond-bertin">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="trivialization-for-the-masses" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/trivialization-for-the-masses">Trivialization for the Masses</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#trivialization-for-the-masses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/trivialization-for-the-masses&quot;&gt;Trivialization for the Masses&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are thousands of visualizations on Many Eyes, but there is little in terms of further analysis and deeper discussion. There are dozens of visualization websites now that let you upload your data, but they all provide the same few visualization techniques and practically no analysis tools.

Which is why I&#39;m excited to have spotted the first third-party implementation of Parallel Sets in the wild: a (Windows-only) program called Knowledge Blocks that allows you to visually piece together a query and show the results in a table or a Parallel Sets display. <em><a href="/blog/2010/parallel-sets-implemented-by-third-party">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-maze-of-twisty-little-passages-all-alike" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/a-maze-of-twisty-little-passages-all-alike">A Maze of Twisty Little Passages, All Alike</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-maze-of-twisty-little-passages-all-alike" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/a-maze-of-twisty-little-passages-all-alike&quot;&gt;A Maze of Twisty Little Passages, All Alike&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Theoretical research is a tough sell, and not just in computer science. Not only are we expected to produce things we can demo, it&#39;s also hard to tell beforehand what exactly the results will be. But that is exactly why we need to do research: because we don&#39;t know.

The visualization is created by a program that can be applied to many datasets, the infographic is hand-crafted for a particular dataset.

He doesn&#39;t tell him anything that&#39;s of interest and then dodges the question Who is Don Draper? by claiming that he was taught as a child not to talk about himself. Scientists do an equally terrible job at communication, and for many of the same reasons. Cornelia Dean&#39;s book Am I Making Myself Clear? offers fascinating insights into both journalism and science, and provides concrete ideas for how to do better. <em><a href="/blog/2010/cornelia-dean-am-i-making-myself-clear">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="various-visweek-workshops" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/various-visweek-workshops">Various VisWeek Workshops</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#various-visweek-workshops" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/various-visweek-workshops&quot;&gt;Various VisWeek Workshops&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I want to call your attention to three interesting workshops that will be held at VisWeek 2010 in October in Salt Lake City.

Ignoring the theoretical side is dangerous, however, because it limits our ability to distill useful information about the foundations of the field from the practical work being done, and limits our understanding of how and why our own creations work. The goal of this workshop at VisWeek 2010 is to bring together researchers interested in the theoretical aspects of visualization, define the field, discuss ideas and approaches, and get the word out about the importance of theoretical research in information visualization. <em><a href="/blog/2010/infovis-theory-workshop">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="infovis-discovery-exhibition-2010" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/infovis-discovery-exhibition-2010">InfoVis Discovery Exhibition 2010</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#infovis-discovery-exhibition-2010" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/infovis-discovery-exhibition-2010&quot;&gt;InfoVis Discovery Exhibition 2010&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Showing the impact of visualization work is not something we as a community are particularly good at.

Its demise can teach us a lot about how visualization for the masses works, and what we need to do to actually make it happen. <em><a href="/blog/2010/end-of-verifiable-com">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="beautiful-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/beautiful-visualization">Beautiful Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#beautiful-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/beautiful-visualization&quot;&gt;Beautiful Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Beautiful Visualization is a collection of essays on a wide range of topics in visualization. Don&#39;t let the title mislead you: while it has its share of artistic visualization, there is also quite a bit of technical information in there. One of the chapters was written by yours truly. <em><a href="/blog/2010/beautiful-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-protovis-primer-part-2" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/protovis-primer-part-2">A Protovis Primer, Part 2</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-protovis-primer-part-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/protovis-primer-part-2&quot;&gt;A Protovis Primer, Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The second installment of the Protovis tutorial introduces some more of its JavaScript-specific features like scales, shows how to anchor marks on other marks, and how to use rules. We also start using real data, and learn how to load that data from a remote source. <em><a href="/blog/2010/protovis-primer-part-2">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="conference-acceptance-rates" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/conference-acceptance-rates">Conference Acceptance Rates</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#conference-acceptance-rates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/conference-acceptance-rates&quot;&gt;Conference Acceptance Rates&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Acceptance rates are one of the key ways of measuring the quality of conferences. I think it&#39;s time we collect that data for conferences relevant to visualization. I have put together a page for this, and have found some of that data. But I need your help to fill in the gaps and suggest other conferences that would be of interest. <em><a href="/blog/2010/conference-acceptance-rates">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-protovis-primer-part-1" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/protovis-primer-part-1">A Protovis Primer, Part 1</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-protovis-primer-part-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/protovis-primer-part-1&quot;&gt;A Protovis Primer, Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Protovis is a very powerful visualization toolkit. Part of what makes it special is that it is written in JavaScript and runs in the browser without the need for any plugins. Its clever use of JavaScript&#39;s language features makes it very elegant, but it can also be confusing to people who are not familiar with functional programming concepts and the finer points of JavaScript. This multi-part tutorial shows how to create a visualization (my interactive Presidents Chart) in Protovis, and explains the concepts that are involved along the way. <em><a href="/blog/2010/protovis-primer-part-1">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="paper-implied-dynamics-in-information-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/implied-dynamics-in-information-visualization">Paper: Implied Dynamics in Information Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#paper-implied-dynamics-in-information-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/implied-dynamics-in-information-visualization&quot;&gt;Paper: Implied Dynamics in Information Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Design is usually considered a minor point in visualization. Does it make a difference what color scheme you use (as long as it&#39;s not an atrocious one), how thick your lines are, whether you put a background behind your chart, etc.? Caroline Ziemkiewicz and I presented a paper at Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI) where we reported on a study we had performed to find out. <em><a href="/blog/2010/implied-dynamics-in-information-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-fascinating-world-of-good-infographics" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/fascinating-world-of-good-infographics">The Fascinating World of (Good) Infographics</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-fascinating-world-of-good-infographics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/fascinating-world-of-good-infographics&quot;&gt;The Fascinating World of (Good) Infographics&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Information graphics (infographics) have gotten a bad rep lately because of a sudden wave of badly designed, uninformative graphics. But when they are done right, infographics can be both highly informative and enjoyable to look at and discover. Here are a few recent examples to demonstrate that. <em><a href="/blog/2010/fascinating-world-of-good-infographics">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="parallel-coordinates" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/parallel-coordinates">Parallel Coordinates</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#parallel-coordinates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/parallel-coordinates&quot;&gt;Parallel Coordinates&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Parallel coordinates are one of the most famous visualization techniques, and among the most common subjects of academic papers in visualization. While initially confusing, they are a very powerful tool for understanding multi-dimensional numerical datasets. <em><a href="/blog/2010/parallel-coordinates">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="visualization-can-never-be-art" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/visualization-can-never-be-art">Visualization Can Never Be Art</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#visualization-can-never-be-art" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/visualization-can-never-be-art&quot;&gt;Visualization Can Never Be Art&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Is visualization art? Are video games art? Is programming art? Is art art? You can discuss these questions at length, but without concrete criteria, they end up being academic exercises rather than leading to some kind of conclusion. One criterion, which I believe to be suited especially well for visualization, is the sublime. Art is sublime, visualization is not. Hence, visualization is not art. <em><a href="/blog/2010/visualization-can-never-be-art">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="chart-junk-considered-useful-after-all" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/chart-junk-considered-useful-after-all">Chart Junk Considered Useful After All</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#chart-junk-considered-useful-after-all" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/chart-junk-considered-useful-after-all&quot;&gt;Chart Junk Considered Useful After All&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There is almost universal agreement that any extraneous elements in a chart or visualization, elements that do not represent numbers, are detrimental to understanding the data. A paper that was presented at CHI recently described a study to figure out just how bad all this chart junk really was. As it turns out, it&#39;s actually rather helpful. <em><a href="/blog/2010/chart-junk-considered-useful-after-all">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="do-mechanical-turks-dream-of-square-pie-charts" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/do-mechnical-turks-dream-of-square-pie-charts">Do Mechanical Turks Dream of Square Pie Charts?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-mechanical-turks-dream-of-square-pie-charts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/do-mechnical-turks-dream-of-square-pie-charts&quot;&gt;Do Mechanical Turks Dream of Square Pie Charts?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>User studies are an important part of visualization, but they also require a considerable amount of effort and time. In a paper presented at the BELIV workshop (part of CHI 2010), we discussed our experiences with running a number of visualization studies using Amazon&#39;s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) service. Using MTurk, we are able to run large studies in much less time than usual, and at very low cost. We also show how to avoid gaming the system, which had been reported in earlier work using MTurk. <em><a href="/blog/2010/do-mechnical-turks-dream-of-square-pie-charts">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-visualization-cargo-cult" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/the-visualization-cargo-cult">The Visualization Cargo Cult</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-visualization-cargo-cult" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/the-visualization-cargo-cult&quot;&gt;The Visualization Cargo Cult&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Visualization is not a very clearly defined field. There are many variations, ways of doing it, and ideas around it. That is valuable, because it keeps the field moving and brings in fresh ideas. But it also brings with it people who like using visualization&#39;s tools and talk about visualization, but what they are doing is something else. We need to start calling these things what they are: a cargo cult of visualization. <em><a href="/blog/2010/the-visualization-cargo-cult">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="a-visual-language-for-proteins-jane-richardson" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/a-visual-language-for-proteins-jane-richardson">A Visual Language for Proteins: Jane Richardson</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-visual-language-for-proteins-jane-richardson" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/a-visual-language-for-proteins-jane-richardson&quot;&gt;A Visual Language for Proteins: Jane Richardson&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Proteins are among the most complex structures we know. They consist of thousands of atoms, and fold into complex shapes to perform a variety of functions. Understanding how they work is not possible from looking at single atoms, but rather at the overall, three-dimensional structure. The visual language for doing this was developed by Jane Richardson. <em><a href="/blog/2010/a-visual-language-for-proteins-jane-richardson">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-year-of-infovis-theory" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/the-year-of-infovis-theory">The Year of InfoVis Theory</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-year-of-infovis-theory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/the-year-of-infovis-theory&quot;&gt;The Year of InfoVis Theory&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>2010 is The Year of Information Visualization Theory. Here&#39;s why. <em><a href="/blog/2010/the-year-of-infovis-theory">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="march-chart-madness" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/march-chart-madness">March Chart Madness</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#march-chart-madness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/march-chart-madness&quot;&gt;March Chart Madness&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Terrible charts seem to be in season. Rarely have I come across so many incredibly bad charts in such a short time: information graphics that don&#39;t actually depict data, distorted representations, useless color schemes, and the worst pie chart ever. <em><a href="/blog/2010/march-chart-madness">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="tableau-public" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/tableau-public">Tableau Public</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tableau-public" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/tableau-public&quot;&gt;Tableau Public&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>With all the data that is now available, more powerful tools are needed to make more sense of it. Tableau Public provides some of the most powerful visualization tools available today, and it&#39;s free to use with public data. <em><a href="/blog/2010/tableau-public">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="itunes-ten-billion-song-downloads-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/itunes-10-billion-song-downloads-visualization">iTunes Ten Billion Song Downloads Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#itunes-ten-billion-song-downloads-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/itunes-10-billion-song-downloads-visualization&quot;&gt;iTunes Ten Billion Song Downloads Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Apple&#39;s iTunes Store is counting down to the ten-billionth (10,000,000,000th) song download. As in previous cases when they were running a download counter on their website, I am harvesting the data and visualizing it below. <em><a href="/blog/2010/itunes-10-billion-song-downloads-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="javascript-the-key-to-in-browser-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/javascript-key-to-in-browser-visualization">JavaScript: The Key to In-Browser Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#javascript-the-key-to-in-browser-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/javascript-key-to-in-browser-visualization&quot;&gt;JavaScript: The Key to In-Browser Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Most data visualization on the web consists of static images. Typical interactive visualizations use Flash or Java, both of which have drawbacks and require plugins, don&#39;t work on mobile devices, etc. A number of recent visualization tools based on JavaScript promise to finally bring visualization to life on the web. The ways they work differ, but they all profit from recent advances in JavaScript performance across all modern browsers. <em><a href="/blog/2010/javascript-key-to-in-browser-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="data-visualization-should-we-divide-it" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/data-visualization-should-we-divide-it">Data Visualization: Should We Divide It?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#data-visualization-should-we-divide-it" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/data-visualization-should-we-divide-it&quot;&gt;Data Visualization: Should We Divide It?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For some time now there has been some discussion about finding a new terminology for the Data Visualization field. The intention is to find names that reflects the two main different directions that are seen today on Dataviz: visual data analysis and data driven aesthetics images. The concern is that Data Visualization might lose its ‘serious’ role as an analytic tool by including works that, without doubt, praise aesthetics before clarity. <em><a href="/blog/2010/data-visualization-should-we-divide-it">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="understanding-pie-charts" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/pie-charts">Understanding Pie Charts</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-pie-charts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/pie-charts&quot;&gt;Understanding Pie Charts&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Pie charts are perhaps the most ubiquitous chart type; they can be found in newspapers, business reports, and many other places. But few people actually understand the function of the pie chart and how to use it properly. In addition to issues stemming from using too many categories, the biggest problem is getting the basic premise: that the pie slices sum up to a meaningful whole. <em><a href="/blog/2010/pie-charts">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-state-of-information-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2010/state-of-infovis-2010">The State of Information Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-state-of-information-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2010/state-of-infovis-2010&quot;&gt;The State of Information Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Information Visualization (InfoVis) is an exciting field to watch grow and expand into ever new areas. Last year brought some interesting developments that point towards changes in how we do and see visualization. What does 2010 hold in store? Here is a look back and some ideas where we&#39;re heading. <em><a href="/blog/2010/state-of-infovis-2010">Read more…</a></em></p></div>`);
