We haven&#39;t done a good publicizing its existence, so here is a reminder and a deadline extension: submit your papers on trust in visualization until April 5!</p><p>So it&#39;s not entirely new, you may remember the EuroVis Workshop on Replicability, Validation, and Verification in Visualization, better known under its highly euphonic acronym, EuroRVVV.</p><p>TrustVis is not just a new name but the attempt to broaden the scope and frame the workshop in a slightly more practice-oriented way (it&#39;s still plenty academic, don&#39;t worry). After all, replication, verification, and validation are all matters of trust in the end. Can we trust this method, this study, this technique, etc.? And how do we know?</p><p>This is also a question when it comes to users exploring a new tool. Does this show me my numbers correctly? Can I read and understand what it produces? What kinds of biases does it create? Do I know how to use it to properly show my data? These are all common and real hurdles in trying to adopt a new tool.</p><p>This even goes into matters of policy. For example, for a long time, doctors had to look at every single slice in a CT scan and could not base their diagnosis on 3D renderings. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s still the case, but trust can clearly have enormous consequences.</p><p>The full call and details on how to submit are available on <a href="https://trustvis.org">the TrustVis website</a>. But the gist of it is: deadline is April 5, we&#39;re looking for short/position papers, the workshop will be held at EuroVis in Porto in early June.</p><p>My co-chairs Kai Lawonn, Lars Linsen, Noeska Smit, and I are looking forward to your submissions!</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on March 19, 2019</em></p></div>`);
