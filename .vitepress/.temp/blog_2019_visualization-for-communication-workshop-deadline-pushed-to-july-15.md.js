If you’re a journalist, designer, communicator, etc., and have interesting work you want to show, send us a brief write-up with a link or video!</p><p>The workshop will be part of <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome">the IEEE VIS conference</a> at the end of October in Vancouver, BC. More information on how to submit, etc., can be found on <a href="https://viscomm.io">the workshop website</a>.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on June 21, 2019</em></p></div>`);
