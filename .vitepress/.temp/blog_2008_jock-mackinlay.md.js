I could see that it was an important book even though I don&#39;t read French. I will never forget the day I found the just-published English translation in a locked cabinet at Stacey&#39;s bookstore. Although it was very expensive for a graduate student, I snapped it up immediately, since it was central to my dissertation work. I agree with Pat Hanrahan that the book is worth multiple readings – in fact, you have to read it multiple times to get the full value.</em></li><li>William S. Cleveland, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Graphing-Data-William-Cleveland/dp/0963488414"><em>The Elements of Graphing Data</em></a> (1980) <em> This book was my introduction to John Tukey&#39;s world of Exploratory Data Analysis, which describes the synergistic relationship of statistics and graphical views of data. I was also influenced by Cleveland&#39;s studies with McGill on the graphical perception of quantitative data.</em></li><li>Edward R. Tufte, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information-2nd/dp/0961392142/"><em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em></a> (1983) <em>Tufte introduced me to the history of the visual display of information.

When I first heard about his dissertation work, I feared that I had been “scooped,” but it turned out that our dissertations were beautifully synergistic. I focused on automatically designing individual graphical views of data, while he focused on automatically telling stories with multiple graphical views. Comparing our dissertations showed me that automatic presentation requires a deep and fundamental understanding of human communication, which is still an open problem. This paper led directly to my research in interactive visualization.</em></li><li>Stuart K. Card, Thomas P. Moran, Allen Newell, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Human-Computer-Interaction-Stuart-Card/dp/0898598591/"><em>The Psychology of Human-Computer Interaction</em></a> (1983) <em> This book introduced me to cognitive science and its application to the engineering of user interfaces, which is central to the design of effective visual analysis tools. After my dissertation, I went to Xerox PARC to work with Stu and Tom. My collaboration with Stu expanded to include George Robertson, who worked with the authors of this book when they were at Carnegie-Mellon University. Stu, George, and I explored 3D graphics and interactive animation, resulting in a research prototype called the Information Visualizer and the coining of the term “information visualization.”</em></li><li>Kim M.

After reading this paper, I accepted with interest and enthusiasm Chris’s invitation to be a member of his dissertation committee. Turned out his dissertation was built directly on ideas from my dissertation. When he later invited me to join him at Tableau Software to commercialize these ideas, I jumped at the chance to bring visual analysis to everyone.</em></li></ul><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on July 29, 2008.
