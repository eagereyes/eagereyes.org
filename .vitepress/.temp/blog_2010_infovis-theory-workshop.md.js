The goal is not to present large bodies of work, but to have the presentations spark discussions.</p><p>As an extension of the workshop, we are planning a special issue of a journal devoted to theoretical work in information visualization.

What makes for a good theory paper? Can a theory paper stand on its own, without an application or immediate use?

I think that for the good of the field there will need to be vibrant community of theoreticians who can advance/challenge the science. There are very good reasons why tool/application papers are abundant (funders like to see stuff, we like to make stuff), but I think the reasons why theory hasn&#39;t moved as quickly are less understood. At least part of the problem is that it&#39;s not easy to conceptualize what constitutes a significant advance in theoretical pursuit.</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
