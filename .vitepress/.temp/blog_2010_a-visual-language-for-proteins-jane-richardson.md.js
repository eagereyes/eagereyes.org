They consist of thousands of atoms, and fold into complex shapes to perform a variety of functions. Understanding how they work is not possible from looking at single atoms, but rather at the overall, three-dimensional structure. The visual language for doing this was developed by Jane Richardson.</p><p>I find it fascinating to learn that concepts and ideas that I take for granted were only invented relatively recently. When we look at visualizations of proteins today, we expect clean, relatively simple shapes: ribbons, helices, and the rope-like structures that connect them. But this is a very abstracted view that was not at all obvious thirty years ago.</p><p>Scientists only figured out how to determine the three-dimensional structure of proteins in the 1970s. When Jane Richardson was writing a review article about the proteins whose structure was known in 1980, she needed a consistent way of showing them. It was clearly not very practical (or useful for understanding) to draw thousands of atoms that were part of a complex, three-dimensional structure.</p><img src="https://media.eagereyes.org/media/2010/proteins.jpg" width="475" height="239" alt="Protein as atoms and abstracted"><p>There are three distinct structures in a protein: <em>alpha-helices</em> (spiral shapes), <em>beta sheets</em> (ribbons), and <em>turns</em> (the &quot;ropes&quot; in-between). Seeing those in the atom structure (above) is almost impossible, but crucial for understanding how a protein works.</p><p>Jane Richardson&#39;s contribution was finding a visual way of representing these components of proteins. Her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribbon_diagram">ribbon diagrams</a> simplify the structure of the protein, and at the same time focus on the important parts. These diagrams were hand-drawn at first; today, any program that shows proteins includes this style of showing them, they are used in textbooks, etc.</p><p>I <a href="/blog/2008/sightings-structures-smaller-than-light.html">interviewed Richardson</a> for the <em>Sightings</em> column in <em>American Scientist</em> a while ago. She is a professor at Duke University and still uses visual means (virtual reality, among them) for teaching and research to further our understanding of complex molecules.</p><hr><p>This is my entry for <a href="http://findingada.com/">Ada Lovelace Day 2010</a>.</p><p>Teaser image: left part by Jane S.

I actually spent some time googling for better computer-generated images, but couldn&#39;t find any. I also implemented a ribbon visualization a while ago for a company, and used less saturated colors there. But they were still a bit on the glossy side and didn&#39;t have the charm of the hand-drawn ones. It would take using some more advanced CG techniques to make these things look better, but it&#39;s definitely doable. Glossy, high-contrast, primary colors are definitely easier to do, though.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://flowingdata.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nathan</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>the hand-drawn ones look way better. that&#39;s often the case, i think. i mean, if a person can draw well in the first place, i&#39;d always put my money on him/her vs a programmer.</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
