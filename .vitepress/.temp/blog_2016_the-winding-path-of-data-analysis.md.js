When you present your results or your insights, you show the logical, straight path. You want to present a sequence of steps that make sense, no matter whether you actually followed them during your analysis or not.</p><p>The human element here is still remarkable, and it makes me very skeptical about automated approaches. A machine might be able to try out lots of things, but how is it going to know which ones are meaningful? How is it going to tell a coherent story about its findings?</p><p>And while I get the idea of <a href="http://www.bitss.org/2014/06/13/preregistration-controversy/">preregistration for studies</a>, I&#39;m not convinced that they&#39;re feasible for the same reason. There&#39;s just too much work that goes into the data analysis that is not mechanical, even without p-hacking.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on October 03, 2016</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Bhushan Karle says…</p><blockquote><p>Great insight.</p></blockquote><p>mjskay says…</p><blockquote><p>While it doesn&#39;t work for every situation (e.g. certain kinds of observational data, existing datasets), pilot studies can help address the difficulty with pre-registration you have identified. Run a pilot, follow the winding path of data analysis (I like this analogy!), record your path (e.g., as an R script). Then run the final study and use the same analysis on it. This can also help in other ways: e.g., if you want to do a power analysis, your pilot gives you the data to do that, which helps you choose the sample size for the full study.</p><p>Of course in practice---limited resources, limited time---it can be hard to do this. In the case where you already have the data, I think another useful approach is model averaging---follow your winding path, but acknowledge your uncertainty in choosing the correct path (model) by averaging over several paths (models) you found.</p><p>(I think the analogy might break down at this point...)</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://civilstatistician.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jerzy</a> says…</p><blockquote><p>I love this comic. And I agree that there are serious concerns about &quot;rote&quot; data analysis getting the right p-values but missing out on insights. (William Cleveland&#39;s books have some great examples.)</p><p>But most of all, thanks for that &quot;preregistration controversy&quot; link, and its link to Cortex and other journals&#39; &quot;Registered Reports.&quot; These seem like a great additional publication option that addresses some of the concerns around preregistration.</p><p>I understand the worry that preregistered &quot;rote&quot; data analysis would prevent you from reporting extra, unexpected findings. But apparently for journals like Cortex, it&#39;s no problem---just report them in a separate &quot;post hoc&quot; section (as long as your main question+study was interesting and well-designed). If anything, those post-hoc things are fodder you can use to preregister your next study and thus expand your CV, <em>whether or not</em> they pan out next time.</p><p>Plus, it&#39;s optional. Nobody&#39;s being banned from publishing their usual studies. It just means there are <em>also</em> places which reward good study design and ignore p-hacking.</p><p>@mjskay: Amen to pilot studies!</p><p>@Robert: Did you mean preregistration is rarely/never feasible? Or it can be feasible, but just shouldn&#39;t be a blanket requirement?</p></blockquote></aside></div>`);
