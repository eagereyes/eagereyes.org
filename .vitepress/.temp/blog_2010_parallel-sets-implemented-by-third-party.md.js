Which is why I&#39;m excited to have spotted the first third-party implementation of <a href="/parallel-sets">Parallel Sets</a> in the wild: a (Windows-only) program called <a href="http://www.knowledgeblocks.eu/kb/Default.aspx">Knowledge Blocks</a> that allows you to visually piece together a query and show the results in a table or a Parallel Sets display.</p><p>It&#39;s not interactive, but it&#39;s a start. And I like the fact that the author makes no big deal about it: it&#39;s just a Parallel Sets view after all, like a scatterplot or maybe Parallel Coordinates.</p><p>There hasn&#39;t been much activity on the Parallel Sets program recently, so I figured I&#39;d use this opportunity to give you a little update. All versions of the program taken together have been downloaded over 1,000 times in the year or so that the program has been available. I am getting emails regularly from people either thanking me for the program (which is awesome) or reporting bugs (which is also great, because it shows that people use it). I am still surprised by the variety of uses people are finding for it: from simple categories to data flow and text mining.</p><p>I have collected a number of important issues that need to be addressed, and I also have a few ideas about new features to add (partly based on suggestions from users). Without committing to a particular date, I am hoping to get the 2.2 release out around VisWeek 2010 (i.e., end of October).</p><p>Next week, I will also be speaking on a panel at the <a href="http://nvac.pnl.gov/meeting_2010/">iVAC Consortium Meeting</a>. That panel will be about getting tools out into the hands of users, so unsurprisingly Parallel Sets will be my topic there.</p><p>Beyond the next release, I am hoping to connect the program a lot more to Parallel Coordinates, and we actually might be getting funding to do that soon. I can&#39;t talk about specifics right now, but it looks promising. So keep your fingers crossed, and I will keep you posted on any and all developments.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on August 22, 2010</em></p></div>`);
