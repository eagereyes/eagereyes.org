After separate postings for Tuesday and Wednesday, this part covers Thursday.

In both, he talks about communicating data and how to deal with numbers for the general public. He recently had two interesting guests back-to-back on his podcast: Nigel Holmes and Edward Tufte.

But there is also a vast body of research, and it is growing every day. Just how does visualization research work? How do we learn new things about visualization and how it can and should be used? <em><a href="/blog/2015/visualization-research-engineering">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="why-is-metadata-so-hard" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/why-is-metadata-so-hard">Why Is Metadata So Hard?</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-metadata-so-hard" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/why-is-metadata-so-hard&quot;&gt;Why Is Metadata So Hard?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The U.S. Department of Education just released an amazing dataset about the costs of going to college, earnings potential, etc. They&#39;re doing so many things right, it&#39;s really great.

Each includes a brief biography, some personal notes by Ben, as well as Ben&#39;s photos of them. The latter are particularly remarkable, often going back to the 1980s – like the gem at the top of this page, showing the man himself in 1986. <em><a href="/blog/2015/encounters-with-hci-pioneers">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="the-point-of-a-chart" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/the-point-of-a-chart">The Point Of A Chart</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-point-of-a-chart" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/the-point-of-a-chart&quot;&gt;The Point Of A Chart&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When creating charts, it&#39;s important to pick the one that actually fits not just the data, but the task. That can require going outside your comfort zone to use something beyond the four or five most common chart types.

My goal was to show people some examples, but also criticize the rather poor visualization culture in bioinformatics and challenge people to do better.

Using the example of the abortion debate, he shows the usual chart tricks, cherry-picking, subsetting, etc., that is done to make the data support a particular story. <em><a href="/blog/2015/disinformation-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="report-eurovis-2015" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/report-eurovis-2015">Report: EuroVis 2015</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#report-eurovis-2015" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/report-eurovis-2015&quot;&gt;Report: EuroVis 2015&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I attended EuroVis 2015 last week in Cagliari, Sardinia. This is the second-most important conference in the academic visualization world, and there were plenty of good sessions to choose from (full and short papers, state-of-the-art reports, and industry sessions). <em><a href="/blog/2015/report-eurovis-2015">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="paper-an-evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts">Paper: An Evaluation of the Impact of Visual Embellishments in Bar Charts</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#paper-an-evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts&quot;&gt;Paper: An Evaluation of the Impact of Visual Embellishments in Bar Charts&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Information graphics often use variations and embellishments of standard charts that may distort the way people read the data. But how bad are these distortions really? In a paper to be presented at EuroVis this week, Drew Skau, Lane Harrison, and I tested their effects in an experiment. <em><a href="/blog/2015/evaluation-of-the-impact-of-visual-embellishments-in-bar-charts">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="eurovis-running-club" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/eurovis-running-club">EuroVis Running Club</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#eurovis-running-club" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/eurovis-running-club&quot;&gt;EuroVis Running Club&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>I&#39;m organizing a very informal running club at EuroVis next week.

When it comes to giving talks, academics would do well to apply some of the thinking behind them to improve their output by observing how it deviates from the desired one, and making changes to adjust it. <em><a href="/blog/2015/feedback-loops-for-better-talks">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="video-the-danger-of-glitziness" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/the-danger-of-glitziness">Video: The Danger of Glitziness</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#video-the-danger-of-glitziness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/the-danger-of-glitziness&quot;&gt;Video: The Danger of Glitziness&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Wayne Lytle created this video about the Viz-O-Matic that provides lots of tools to make visualization glitzier. It&#39;s a nice little spoof, and a throwback to the computer graphics of the early 1990s (it was made for SIGGRAPH 1993). This video was brought up in a discussion about storytelling at CHI last week, though I don&#39;t think that its lessons are very deep on that subject. <em><a href="/blog/2015/the-danger-of-glitziness">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="conference-report-chi-2015" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/conference-report-chi-2015">Conference Report: CHI 2015</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#conference-report-chi-2015" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/conference-report-chi-2015&quot;&gt;Conference Report: CHI 2015&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Last week, I had the pleasure of attending the CHI 2015 conference in Seoul, South Korea. CHI technically stands for Computer-Human Interaction, but it has become a name rather than an acronym in recent years.

The same is true for using shapes other than rectangles. Neither is based on much actual research, however. In a new paper, we look at the specific example of ISOTYPE-style charts – and find them to be quite effective. <em><a href="/blog/2015/isotype-visualization">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="link-design-and-redesign-in-data-visualization" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/design-and-redesign-in-data-visualization">Link: Design and Redesign in Data Visualization</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#link-design-and-redesign-in-data-visualization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/design-and-redesign-in-data-visualization&quot;&gt;Link: Design and Redesign in Data Visualization&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg have written a wonderful piece titled Design and Redesign in Data Visualization about criticism in data visualization.

It can also be a tool to communicate a fact, an amount, or an issue beyond just the sheer numbers.

It is also the one that has its 30th birthday this year, having been published in August 1985.

This is interesting for several reasons. For one, it shows that the field is still very young. Most research fields go back much, much further. Even within such a short time frame, though, there is a danger of not knowing some of the most important pieces of research. <em><a href="/blog/2015/introduction">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="link-data-stories-podcast-2014-review" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/data-stories-podcast-2014-review">Link: Data Stories Podcast 2014 Review</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#link-data-stories-podcast-2014-review" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/data-stories-podcast-2014-review&quot;&gt;Link: Data Stories Podcast 2014 Review&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Episode 46 of the Data Stories podcast features Andy Kirk and yours truly in an epic battle for podcast dominance a review of the year 2014. <em><a href="/blog/2015/data-stories-podcast-2014-review">Read more…</a></em></p><h3 id="link-data-viz-done-right" tabindex="-1"><a href="/blog/2015/link-data-viz-done-right">Link: Data Viz Done Right</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#link-data-viz-done-right" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/link-data-viz-done-right&quot;&gt;Link: Data Viz Done Right&lt;/a&gt;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Andy Kriebel&#39;s Data Viz Done Right is a remarkable little website.
