While the exhibit is certainly informative and important, it does not fit into an art museum.</p><p>In fact, the exhibit is highly frustrating. Expecting art, you suddenly feel like you stumbled into a museum of natural history, or of science and technology. There is nothing wrong with those, but that&#39;s not what I come to the MCA for. And the exhibit hardly even tries to be artistic – or daring, for that matter. If you have any idea of what is going on in the world in terms of energy use and trying to reduce it, you won&#39;t see much that is new here.</p><p>This makes for a nice case study of how different art and information really are. See also my <a href="/VisCrit/InformativeArt.html">thoughts on Informative Art</a>, and there is also a forthcoming posting here on a related matter (coming soon). It is a big mistake to just treat them like they are one and the same. They&#39;re not.</p><p><em>Posted by <a href="/about">Robert Kosara</a> on December 26, 2006</em></p><aside class="comments"><hr><h2 id="comments" tabindex="-1">Comments <a class="header-anchor" href="#comments" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Comments&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Mark says…</p><blockquote><p>I visited the Museum of Contemporary Art, once, many years ago.
