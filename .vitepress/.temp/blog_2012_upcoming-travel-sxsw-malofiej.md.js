There are two parts to this: the awards themselves, which are judged by an international group of practitioners and academics in a variety of fields, and the summit where a number of interesting people are going to speak. The <a href="http://www.malofiej20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/malofiej20_programa_ONLINE.pdf">program for the latter (PDF)</a> is online, and the lineup is very impressive.
